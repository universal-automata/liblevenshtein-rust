## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-15

### Added

#### Phase 3b: Phonetic Operations - Partial Implementation (2025-11-14)
- **Phonetic Split Operations ⟨1,2⟩ (92% complete - 22/24 tests passing)**
  - Implemented split operations for single-to-multi-character phonetic transformations (k→ch, t→th, s→sh, f→ph)
  - Added `entry_char` field to ISplitting/MSplitting positions to track character at split entry
  - Prevents spurious split entry by validating input character matches target's first character
  - Prioritizes phonetic splits (errors+0, fractional weight) over standard splits (errors+1)
  - Handles negative match_index in split completion when offset becomes very negative

- **New SubstitutionSet APIs**
  - `has_source(&self, source: &[u8]) -> bool`: Check if source exists in restriction set
  - `has_target_starting_with(&self, source: &[u8], first_char: char) -> bool`: Validate target starts with given character
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 7 new unit tests
  - Supports both single-byte and multi-char storage architectures

- **New OperationType APIs**
  - `can_apply_to_source(&self, dict_chars: &[u8]) -> bool`: Validate source without target for speculative split entry
  - `matches_first_target_char(&self, dict_chars: &[u8], first_target_char: char) -> bool`: Validate first character of split target
  - Full documentation with examples and theoretical justification for locality property
  - Enables generic phonetic split detection without hard-coding operation targets

### Fixed

#### Phase 3b Bug Fixes (2025-11-14)
- **Entry Character Architecture Issue**
  - Fixed: `previous_input_char` was shared at state level, causing incorrect character for parallel exploration paths
  - Solution: Store `entry_char` in each splitting position to track character read when entering that specific split
  - Impact: Enables correct double-split operations like "kat"→"chath" (k→ch, t→th)

- **Split Entry Priority Issue**
  - Fixed: Both phonetic and standard splits were being entered simultaneously, exhausting error budget
  - Solution: Use if-else chain to prioritize phonetic splits (errors+0) over standard splits (errors+1)
  - Impact: Phonetic operations take precedence when both conditions are met

- **Split Entry Validation Issue**
  - Fixed: Splits were entered speculatively without checking if input character matches target's first character
  - Solution: Validate with `matches_first_target_char()` before entering split state
  - Impact: Prevents entering t→th split when reading 'a' instead of 't'

- **I-Splitting Invariant Issue**
  - Fixed: Standard invariant `|offset| <= errors` too restrictive for accumulated errors from other operations
  - Solution: Relaxed invariant for errors > 0 using subsumption-based constraints (errors >= -offset - n, offset >= -2*n)
  - Impact: Allows phonetic splits from positions with accumulated errors (e.g., after k→ch + insert 'a' + t→th)

- **Negative Match Index Handling**
  - Fixed: When offset becomes very negative (< -n), match_index calculation wraps on usize cast
  - Solution: Check if match_index_i32 < 0 before casting, use full_word fallback for extraction
  - Impact: Prevents undefined behavior in word character extraction during split completion

### Changed

#### Generalized Position Updates (2025-11-14)
- Updated ISplitting and MSplitting position variants to include `entry_char: char` field
- Modified subsumption logic to handle new entry_char field with pattern matching wildcards
- Updated all position creation call sites in state transition functions
- Enhanced position constructors (`new_i_splitting`, `new_m_splitting`) with entry_char parameter
- All 4 new tests for splitting position constructors passing

### Technical Details

#### Architecture Changes (2025-11-14)
- **Files Modified**: 6 core files (substitution_set.rs, operation_type.rs, position.rs, state.rs, subsumption.rs, automaton.rs)
- **Test Coverage**: 22/24 phonetic tests passing (91.7% success rate, up from 90.5%)
- **API Additions**: 4 new public methods with full documentation
- **Test Additions**: 11 new unit tests (7 for SubstitutionSet, 4 for positions)

#### Remaining Work (2025-11-14)
- 2 failing tests: `test_phonetic_split_multiple`, `test_phonetic_split_with_standard_ops`
- Issue: Word character extraction in edge cases when offset < -n
- Root cause: Complex interaction between word_slice vs full_word extraction logic
- Impact: Affects consecutive phonetic splits with accumulated errors

### Performance

### Fixed

#### DynamicDawg Insert Bug (2025-11-04)
- **Critical bug fix: Suffix sharing causing incorrect term acceptance**
  - Fixed bug where inserting "j" into ["kb", "jb"] caused "k" to be marked as valid
  - Root cause: Phase 2.1 suffix sharing created shared entry nodes
  - When both 'j' and 'k' edges pointed to same node, marking it final affected both paths
  - Solution: Disabled Phase 2.1 suffix sharing optimization
  - Trade-off: ~20-40% higher memory usage (mitigated by periodic compaction)
  - Preserved suffix sharing methods for future optimization work

  - Found by property-based testing (proptest)
  - Created minimal reproducing test case in `tests/debug_proptest_failure.rs`
  - All 20 DynamicDawg unit tests pass
  - All 19 integration tests pass

  - Accelerates `contains()` operations by rejecting non-existent terms early
  - Zero false negatives, <1% false positive rate with default configuration
  - Configurable via `with_config()` API: `DynamicDawg::with_config(f32::INFINITY, Some(10000))`
  - Benchmarks: contains() operations improved from ~38µs to ~3µs (10-12x faster)
  - Minimal memory overhead: ~1.25 bytes per term

- **Lazy Auto-Minimization** (30% improvement for large datasets)
  - Automatic minimize() triggering based on configurable growth threshold
  - Default: disabled (threshold = f32::INFINITY), opt-in via `with_config()`
  - Configurable threshold: `DynamicDawg::with_config(1.5, None)` minimizes at 50% growth
  - Benchmark results: 30% faster insertions for 1000+ term datasets
  - Prevents unbounded memory growth during bulk insertions
  - Trade-off: adds ~5-10% overhead for small datasets (<100 terms)

- **Sorted Batch Insertion** (4-8% improvement)
  - `from_terms()` now pre-sorts input before insertion
  - Better prefix/suffix sharing leads to more compact DAWG structure
  - Benchmark results: 4-8% faster construction for typical workloads
  - No API changes required - optimization is transparent

### Fixed

#### Test Compilation (2025-11-04)
- **Fixed feature-gated test compilation error**
  - Added `#[cfg(feature = "pathmap-backend")]` to `test_dynamic_dawg_char_value_filtered_query()` in tests/test_dynamic_dawg_char.rs
  - Test uses `FuzzyMultiMap` from `cache` module which requires `pathmap-backend` feature
  - Ensures tests compile successfully both with and without optional features
  - Resolves: `error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find 'cache' in 'liblevenshtein'`

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (2025-11-04)
- **Fixed crates.io publishing workflow failure**
  - Added sed command to convert `pathmap-backend = ["pathmap"]` to empty marker feature `pathmap-backend = []`
  - Release workflow comments out PathMap git dependency for crates.io compatibility
  - After commenting dependency, feature definition must also be updated to avoid Cargo validation error
  - Resolves: `feature 'pathmap-backend' includes 'pathmap' which is neither a dependency nor another feature`
  - File: `.github/workflows/release.yml` line 454-456

#### Code Quality (2025-11-04)
