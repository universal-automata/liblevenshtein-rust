//! State allocation pool for reducing cloning overhead.
//!
//! The StatePool manages a pool of reusable State allocations to avoid
//! repeatedly allocating and deallocating States during query processing.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! From profiling, State cloning accounts for 21.73% of runtime:
//! - Vec allocation: 6.00%
//! - Position copies: 7.44%
//! - Misc overhead: ~8%
//!
//! By reusing State allocations, we eliminate the Vec allocation overhead
//! and reduce overall cloning cost by an estimated 10-15%.

use super::state::State;

/// Pool of reusable State allocations.
///
/// The pool maintains a collection of States that can be reused across
/// multiple transitions within a single query, eliminating the need to
/// repeatedly allocate and deallocate Vec<Position> structures.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut pool = StatePool::new();
///
/// // Acquire a state (from pool or allocate new)
/// let mut state = pool.acquire();
///
/// // Use the state...
/// state.insert(Position::new(0, 0));
///
/// // Return to pool when done
/// pool.release(state);
/// ```
///
/// # Pool Management
///
/// - **Initial capacity:** 16 states
/// - **Maximum capacity:** 32 states (to prevent unbounded growth)
/// - **Reuse strategy:** LIFO (last-in, first-out) for cache locality
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// StatePool is NOT thread-safe. Each query should have its own pool.
/// For parallel queries, use thread-local pools or one pool per thread.
