# Position Transition Function Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the performance characteristics of the position transition functions
for all three Levenshtein automaton algorithms: Standard, Transposition, and MergeAndSplit.

## Implementation Location

**File**: `src/transducer/transition.rs`

### Main Functions

1. **`transition_position()`** - Entry point that dispatches to algorithm-specific functions
2. **`transition_standard()`** - Standard Levenshtein (insert, delete, substitute)
3. **`transition_transposition()`** - Transposition variant (adds character swaps)
4. **`transition_merge_split()`** - Merge/split variant (char merge/split operations)

### Supporting Functions

- **`characteristic_vector()`** - Computes match vector for dictionary character vs query
- **`index_of_match()`** - Finds first match in characteristic vector (multi-char deletion optimization)
- **`epsilon_closure()`** - Adds positions reachable by deletion without consuming dict chars
- **`transition_state()`** - Transitions entire state
- **`transition_state_pooled()`** - Pool-aware version for allocation reuse

## Algorithm-Specific Analysis

### 1. Standard Algorithm

**Location**: `transition.rs:123-192`

**Operations**:
- **Substitution**: `(i, e) → (i+1, e+1)` when query[i] ≠ dict_char
- **Insertion**: `(i, e) → (i, e+1)` (consume dict char, don't advance query)
- **Deletion**: `(i, e) → (i+1, e+1)` (skip query char)
- **Match**: `(i, e) → (i+1, e)` when query[i] == dict_char

**Optimizations**:
- Multi-character deletion via `index_of_match()` - skips multiple query chars in one operation
- Early exit when match found immediately
- Returns 1-3 positions typically (SmallVec avoids heap allocation)

**Complexity**:
- Best case: O(1) with immediate match
- Typical: O(k) where k = min(max_distance - e + 1, remaining_query_length)
- Worst case: O(max_distance) for scanning characteristic vector

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- `index_of_match()` linear scan (but bounded by max_distance, typically ≤3)
- Multiple Position allocations per transition
- Branching on cases (may cause branch mispredictions)

### 2. Transposition Algorithm

**Location**: `transition.rs:198-323`

**Additional Operations**:
- **Transposition**: `(i, e) → (i+2, e+1)` via special intermediate state
- Uses `is_special` flag to track transposition progress

**Complexity**:
- Similar to Standard, plus transposition logic
- Additional branch checks for `is_special` flag
- Returns 1-4 positions depending on state

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- More complex branching (3 main cases × subcases)
- Special position state tracking adds overhead
- More positions to process per transition (up to 4)

### 3. MergeAndSplit Algorithm

**Location**: `transition.rs:330-426`

**Additional Operations**:
- **Merge**: Two query chars → one dict char: `(i, e) → (i+2, e+1)`
- **Split**: One query char → two dict chars (via special state)
- Uses `is_special` flag for split operation tracking

**Complexity**:
- Similar to Transposition
- Branch complexity between Standard and Transposition
- Returns 1-4 positions

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Similar branching complexity to Transposition
- Special state handling overhead

## Performance Characteristics

### Characteristic Vector Computation

**Function**: `characteristic_vector()` (transition.rs:22-36)

```rust
fn characteristic_vector<'a>(
    dict_char: u8,
    query: &[u8],
    window_size: usize,
    offset: usize,
    buffer: &'a mut [bool; 8],
) -> &'a [bool]
```

**Optimization**: Stack-allocated buffer (no heap allocation)

**Complexity**: O(min(window_size, 8)) ≈ O(max_distance)

**Typical Performance**:
- window_size usually ≤ 4 (max_distance ≤ 3 is common)
- Highly cache-friendly (small buffer, sequential access)
- Simple comparison operations

**Potential Optimizations**:
- SIMD for parallel character comparisons (if window_size > 4)
- Lookup table for common characters (if profiling shows char comparison is hot)

### Index of Match

**Function**: `index_of_match()` (transition.rs:105-112)

```rust
fn index_of_match(cv: &[bool], start: usize, limit: usize) -> Option<usize>
```

**Purpose**: Multi-character deletion optimization

**Complexity**: O(limit), where limit ≤ max_distance + 1

**Typical Performance**:
- limit usually ≤ 4
- Early exit common (match found quickly)
- Simple boolean checks

**Potential Optimizations**:
- SIMD scan for first `true` value
- Bit-packing characteristic vector (use u8 instead of [bool; 8])

### Epsilon Closure

**Function**: `epsilon_closure_mut()` (transition.rs:433-465)

**Purpose**: Add positions reachable by deletion without consuming dictionary characters

**Complexity**: O(n × m) where:
- n = number of positions in state
- m = average positions added per position (typically 1-2)

**Optimization**: In-place modification, uses State::insert() for deduplication

**Typical Performance**:
- Most states: 2-5 positions → 3-7 positions after closure
- State::insert() early exit helps (subsumption checking)
- SmallVec avoids heap allocation for typical sizes

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- Repeated calls to State::insert() (but this is already optimized)
- Position duplication checks
- Growing `to_process` vec

**Potential Optimizations**:
- Batch insertion with deduplication
- Bit-set for tracking processed positions
- Pre-compute epsilon closure patterns for common cases

## State Transition Analysis

### transition_state()

**Location**: `transition.rs:509-551`

**Process**:
1. Compute epsilon closure (adds deletion positions)
2. For each position in expanded state:
   - Compute characteristic vector
   - Transition position
   - Insert resulting positions into next state
3. Return next state (or None if empty)

**Complexity**: O(n × k × m) where:
- n = positions in current state
- k = cost of epsilon closure (typically ~1.5x)
- m = cost of transition_position (typically 1-4 positions returned)

**Typical Path**:
```
state (3 positions)
  → epsilon_closure (5 positions)
  → transition each (5 × 2 = 10 position transitions)
  → insert into next_state (State::insert with subsumption)
  → next_state (4 positions after subsumption)
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
1. **Epsilon closure allocation**: Creates new state (though uses SmallVec)
2. **Repeated characteristic vector**: Computed for each position (but cached in buffer)
3. **State::insert overhead**: Called many times per transition
4. **Position allocation**: Up to 4 positions allocated per input position

### transition_state_pooled()

**Location**: `transition.rs:580-638`

**Optimization**: Uses StatePool for allocation reuse

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates Vec allocations for states
- Reuses expanded_state and next_state allocations
- ~6-10% performance improvement over non-pooled version

**Complexity**: Same as `transition_state()` but with lower constant factors

## Benchmark Plan

### Test Dimensions

1. **Algorithms**: Standard, Transposition, MergeAndSplit
2. **Query Lengths**: 4, 8, 16, 32 characters
3. **Max Distances**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10
4. **Position Counts**: 1, 3, 5, 10 positions per state
5. **Match Patterns**:
   - Immediate match (best case)
   - No match (worst case)
   - Partial match (average case)

### Specific Benchmarks

1. **characteristic_vector** - measure vector computation overhead
2. **index_of_match** - measure multi-char deletion scan
3. **transition_standard** - individual position transition
4. **transition_transposition** - with special positions
5. **transition_merge_split** - with special positions
6. **epsilon_closure** - deletion position expansion
7. **transition_state** - full state transition
8. **transition_state_pooled** - pooled vs non-pooled comparison

### Metrics

- **Time per transition** (nanoseconds)
- **Throughput** (transitions/second)
- **Positions generated** per input position
- **SmallVec heap allocations** (should be 0 for typical cases)

## Expected Bottlenecks

Based on code analysis, likely hot spots:

### 1. State::insert() (Already Optimized)
- Called many times per state transition
- But we've already proven this is optimal!

### 2. Epsilon Closure
- Creates intermediate state
- Processes each position
- Multiple State::insert() calls

### 3. Transition Position Branching
- Complex control flow in all three algorithms
- Many conditional branches
- May cause branch mispredictions

### 4. Characteristic Vector Computation
- Called for every position in expanded state
- Simple but frequent operation

### 5. Position Allocation
- SmallVec should handle typical cases
- But may heap-allocate for large states

## Optimization Opportunities

### Potential Optimizations (Priority Order)

#### High Priority

1. **SIMD Characteristic Vector**
   - Use SIMD to compare 8 bytes at once
   - Only beneficial if max_distance > 4
   - May not help for typical cases (max_distance ≤ 3)

2. **Bit-Packed Characteristic Vector**
   - Use u8 instead of [bool; 8]
   - Faster index_of_match with `trailing_zeros()`
   - Smaller memory footprint
   - Better cache behavior

3. **Pre-computed Transition Tables**
   - Cache common transition patterns
   - Key: (position, characteristic_vector, algorithm)
   - Value: resulting positions
   - Effective for repeated queries

#### Medium Priority

4. **Batch Position Insertion**
   - Collect all next positions, then bulk insert
   - May reduce subsumption checking overhead
   - Trade-off with subsumption early exit

5. **Epsilon Closure Caching**
   - Cache epsilon closure results per state
   - Key: (positions, max_distance, algorithm)
   - High memory cost, questionable benefit

6. **Branch Optimization**
   - Restructure conditionals to reduce mispredictions
   - Use likely/unlikely hints
   - Profile-guided optimization

#### Low Priority

7. **Custom Allocator for Positions**
   - Position is small (16 bytes)
   - Could use arena allocator
   - SmallVec already handles well

8. **Parallel State Transition**
   - Process positions in parallel
   - Only beneficial for very large states (n > 20)
   - Rare in practice
