## Key Results Summary

### Cumulative Improvements (Baseline → Phase 6)

| Workload | Improvement |
|----------|-------------|
| Distance 2 queries | **-48%** |
| Distance 3 queries | **-42%** |
| Long queries (13 chars) | **-45%** |
| Medium/large dictionaries | **-40% to -43%** |
| Standard algorithm | **-32%** |
| Small dictionaries | **-52%** (net) |

### Profiling Evidence

- **Phase 3**: Dictionary edges reduced from 27% to ~13%
- **Phase 5**: State::clone eliminated (21.73% → 0%)
- **Phase 6**: Intersection::clone reduced by 72% (21.23% → 5.90%)

**Total: ~50% of original runtime overhead eliminated!**

## Optimization Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Transducer layer optimizations (2-18% improvements)
2. **Phase 2**: Profiling discovery (identified dictionary bottleneck at 27%)
3. **Phase 3**: Lazy edge iterator (15-50% improvements)
4. **Phase 4**: SmallVec investigation (not adopted - workload variability)
5. **Phase 5**: StatePool allocation reuse (9-34% improvements, State::clone eliminated)
6. **Phase 6**: Arc path sharing (7-19% improvements, 72% Intersection::clone reduction)

## Key Takeaways

- **Profile before optimizing** - Assumptions about bottlenecks were wrong
- **Benchmark every change** - Only way to discover trade-offs
- **Follow the data** - Each profiling round revealed the next optimization target
- **Persistence pays off** - Multiple approaches led to exceptional results
- **Accept trade-offs** - Arc path regression on small dicts (+5.5%) is worth massive gains elsewhere (7-19%)
