# Query Iterator Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the performance characteristics of query iterators in liblevenshtein-rust, focusing on the ordered query iterator after fixing two critical bugs.

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Large Distance Queries Dropping Results
**Location**: `src/transducer/ordered_query.rs:126-197`

**Problem**: Queries with large max_distance (e.g., 99) were only returning a subset of results.

**Root Cause**: The advance() method had a strict equality check `distance == self.current_distance` which caused results to be silently dropped when their actual distance (from `infer_distance()`) differed from their bucket's distance (from `min_distance()`).

**Solution**: Implemented re-queuing logic that moves intersections to the correct distance bucket when `distance > current_distance`.

**Impact**: All matching terms within max_distance are now correctly returned.

### Bug #2: Lexicographic Ordering Not Maintained
**Location**: `src/transducer/ordered_query.rs:64-83, 126-197`

**Problem**: Results at the same distance level were not properly sorted lexicographically.

**Root Cause**: VecDeque is FIFO - results came out in insertion order rather than lexicographic order. DAWG edges are iterated in sorted order, but items discovered at different tree depths don't maintain this ordering.

**Solution**:
- Added `sorted_buffer: Vec<OrderedCandidate>` and `buffer_index: usize` fields to the struct
- Modified `advance()` to collect all results at the current distance level, sort them by term, then yield them in order
- This ensures proper lexicographic ordering within each distance bucket

**Impact**: Results now correctly satisfy the ordering guarantee: distance-first, then lexicographic.

## Performance Characteristics

### Ordered Query Iterator (`OrderedQueryIterator`)

#### Current Implementation
```rust
pub struct OrderedQueryIterator<N: DictionaryNode> {
    pending_by_distance: Vec<VecDeque<Box<Intersection<N>>>>,
    current_distance: usize,
    max_distance: usize,
    query: Vec<u8>,
    algorithm: Algorithm,
    state_pool: StatePool,
    substring_mode: bool,
    sorted_buffer: Vec<OrderedCandidate>,
    buffer_index: usize,
}
```

#### Hot Paths

1. **`advance()` method** (lines 126-197):
   - Called on every `next()` iteration
   - Contains the core logic for distance-level iteration
   - Key operations:
     - Buffer checking and yielding (lines 127-131)
     - Distance bucket exhaustion loop (lines 135-194)
     - Result collection into buffer (line 162)
     - **Buffer sorting** (line 185): `sorted_buffer.sort_by(|a, b| a.term.cmp(&b.term))`
     - Term materialization (line 161): `intersection.term()`

2. **`queue_children()` method** (lines 199-212):
   - Called for each intersection to explore children
   - Iterates over DAWG edges (lexicographically sorted)
   - Calls `transition_state_pooled()` - likely expensive
   - Creates PathNode boxes for parent chain
   - Creates Intersection boxes

#### Potential Bottlenecks

1. **Buffer Sorting Overhead**:
   - **Location**: Line 185 in `advance()`
   - **Operation**: `sorted_buffer.sort_by(|a, b| a.term.cmp(&b.term))`
   - **Frequency**: Once per distance level
   - **Complexity**: O(n log n) where n = number of results at current distance
   - **Impact**: For queries returning many results at the same distance (e.g., distance 3-5), this could be significant
   - **Mitigation Options**:
     - Use a heap/priority queue structure (BinaryHeap) instead of Vec + sort
     - Consider maintaining sorted order during insertion (insertion sort for small n)
     - Profile to determine if this is actually a bottleneck

2. **Term Materialization**:
   - **Location**: Line 161 and line 148 in `advance()`
   - **Operation**: `intersection.term()` - reconstructs the full term string from PathNode chain
   - **Frequency**: Once per result
   - **Complexity**: O(k) where k = term length, involves string allocation
   - **Impact**: Could be significant for long terms or many results
   - **Note**: Necessary for sorting, but could be optimized if term construction is expensive

3. **Box Allocations**:
   - **Location**: Lines 196-204 in `queue_children()`
   - **Operations**:
     - `Box::new(PathNode::new(...))` (line 196)
     - `Box::new(Intersection::with_parent(...))` (line 199)
   - **Frequency**: Once per edge traversed
   - **Impact**: Memory allocation overhead, though StatePool mitigates this for States

4. **State Transitions**:
   - **Location**: Lines 182-190 in `queue_children()`
   - **Operation**: `transition_state_pooled()`
   - **Frequency**: Once per edge traversed
   - **Complexity**: Depends on algorithm (Standard/Transposition/MergeAndSplit)
   - **Impact**: Likely the primary computational cost
   - **Note**: Already uses StatePool for allocation reuse

5. **Distance Bucket Requeuing**:
   - **Location**: Lines 166-169 in `advance()`
   - **Operation**: Moving intersections to correct distance bucket when min_dist underestimates
   - **Frequency**: Varies based on query and dictionary
   - **Impact**: Adds extra processing, but necessary for correctness

## Performance Comparison

### Ordered vs Unordered Query

**Ordered Query**:
- Must process entire distance level before moving to next
- Requires sorting results within each distance
- Memory overhead: sorted_buffer
- Benefit: Enables efficient top-k queries and early termination

**Unordered Query**:
- Can yield results immediately upon discovery
- No sorting overhead
- Less memory overhead
- Drawback: Results in arbitrary order

### Expected Performance Trade-offs

1. **Distance 0 (exact match)**: Ordered and unordered should be roughly equivalent
2. **Distance 1-2**: Ordered has sorting overhead, but minimal for small result sets
3. **Distance 3+**: Sorting overhead grows as result sets expand
4. **Large distances (10+)**: Significant sorting overhead if many results per distance level

## Optimization Opportunities

### High Priority

1. **Profile Buffer Sorting**:
   - Measure actual time spent in `sort_by`
   - If significant, consider BinaryHeap or other sorted data structure
   - Benchmark: `bench_ordered_query_sorting_overhead` in query_iterator_benchmarks.rs

2. **Optimize Term Materialization**:
   - Profile `intersection.term()` cost
   - Consider caching if terms are accessed multiple times
   - Investigate PathNode traversal efficiency

### Medium Priority

3. **Reduce Allocations**:
   - Consider arena allocator for PathNode boxes
   - Investigate if Intersection boxes can be pooled
   - Profile allocation overhead

4. **Early Buffer Optimization**:
   - For small buffer sizes (< 10), insertion sort might be faster than sort_by
   - Consider adaptive sorting strategy

### Low Priority

5. **Buffer Capacity Hints**:
   - Pre-allocate buffer based on heuristics (e.g., 2^distance)
   - Reduce reallocation overhead

6. **SIMD Optimizations**:
   - String comparison in sorting could use SIMD
   - Would require unsafe code and architecture-specific implementation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix bugs in ordered query

5. ⏳ Analyze flame graphs to identify actual bottlenecks
6. ⏳ Implement optimizations based on profiling data
7. ⏳ Re-test and verify performance improvements

## Conclusion

The ordered query iterator has been successfully debugged and now correctly:
1. Returns all results within max_distance
2. Maintains lexicographic ordering within each distance level

The primary potential bottleneck is the buffer sorting operation, which occurs once per distance level. Profiling is needed to determine if this is actually significant in practice, or if the state transition operations dominate the runtime.

The comprehensive benchmarks and tests provide a solid foundation for identifying and validating optimizations.
