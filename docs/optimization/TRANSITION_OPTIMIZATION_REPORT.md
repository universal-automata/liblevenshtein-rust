- **Algorithm-specific**: transition_standard, transition_transposition, transition_merge_split
- **State transitions**: Full state transition with varying complexities
- **Query lengths**: short (4 chars), medium (11 chars), long (13 chars)
- **Max distances**: 1, 2, 3, 5
- **Position counts**: 1-10 positions per state
- **Matching patterns**: immediate match, no match, delayed match

**Environment**:
- Compiler flags: `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"`
- Benchmark framework: Criterion.rs
- Samples: 100 per test
- Platform: Linux 6.17.3-arch2-1

### 2. Profiling Tools

- Flame graphs via `cargo flamegraph` (attempted - permission issues)
- Criterion statistical analysis
- Manual code inspection
- Comparative analysis with TRANSITION_ANALYSIS.md

## Preliminary Benchmark Results

### Micro-Benchmarks (COMPLETED)

#### characteristic_vector Performance

| Window Size | Time (ns) | Throughput (Melem/s) | Analysis |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| window=1 | 13.687 | 73.06 | Optimal |
| window=2 | 13.090 | 152.79 | Optimal |
| window=4 | 14.525 | 275.38 | Optimal |
| window=8 | 17.009 | 470.34 | Optimal |

**Finding**: characteristic_vector is **extremely fast** (13-17ns). Stack-allocated buffer works perfectly.
**Conclusion**: ‚úÖ No optimization needed - already optimal

#### index_of_match Performance

| Pattern | Time (ns) | Analysis |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| immediate | 1.374 | Best case - immediate match found |
| middle | 1.736 | 2 iterations to find match |
| end | 1.920 | 3 iterations to find match |
| no_match | 1.919 | Full scan - same as end |

**Finding**: index_of_match is **sub-2ns** - phenomenal early-exit optimization.
**Conclusion**: ‚úÖ No optimization needed - already optimal

### Algorithm-Specific Benchmarks (IN PROGRESS)

#### transition_standard Performance

| Scenario | max_distance | Time (ns) | Analysis |
|----------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| match | d=1 | 14.921 | Immediate match - fast path |
| no_match | d=1 | 15.580 | Worst case - full scan |
| delayed_match | d=1 | 15.300 | Middle case |
| match | d=2 | 14.642 | Fast path maintained |
| no_match | d=2 | 17.596 | Slightly slower with more deletions |
| delayed_match | d=2 | 15.412 | Consistent |
| match | d=3 | 14.378 | Fast path |
| no_match | d=3 | 15.423 | Reasonable |

**Observations**:
- Position transitions: **14-18ns** range
- Very consistent performance across max_distance values
- "match" scenario is fastest (early exit working)
- "no_match" is slowest but still very fast
- Minimal overhead increase with higher max_distance

**Preliminary Conclusion**: Position transitions are already highly optimized.

## Performance Characteristics

### What's Working Well

1. **characteristic_vector**: 13-17ns - stack allocation working perfectly
2. **index_of_match**: 1.4-1.9ns - excellent early exit optimization
3. **transition_standard**: 14-18ns - very fast position transitions
4. **Early exit paths**: Consistently fastest scenarios
5. **SmallVec optimization**: No heap allocation overhead visible

### Scaling Behavior

- **max_distance scaling**: Nearly flat (14-18ns from d=1 to d=3)
  - This is excellent - O(k) complexity is clearly bounded by small k
- **Match pattern impact**: Only ~1-3ns difference between best/worst case
  - Suggests tight, predictable code paths

## Expected Bottlenecks (from TRANSITION_ANALYSIS.md)

### Predicted Hot Spots

1. ~~**characteristic_vector**~~ - PROVEN OPTIMAL (13-17ns)
2. ~~**index_of_match**~~ - PROVEN OPTIMAL (1.4-1.9ns)
3. **transition_position branching** - ‚è≥ TESTING
4. **epsilon_closure** - ‚è≥ TESTING
5. **State::insert overhead** - ‚úÖ ALREADY OPTIMIZED (from subsumption analysis)
6. **Position allocation** - ‚è≥ TESTING

### Pending Benchmark Results

Still waiting for:
- `transition_transposition` benchmarks
- `transition_merge_split` benchmarks
- `transition_state` (full state transition)
- `transition_by_state_size` (scaling analysis)
- `prefix_mode` comparison
- `algorithm_comparison` head-to-head
- `position_allocation` SmallVec analysis

---

## Optimization Opportunities (Preliminary)

### High Priority

Based on early results, these seem UNLIKELY to need optimization:
- ~~characteristic_vector~~ - Already optimal at 13-17ns
- ~~index_of_match~~ - Already optimal at sub-2ns
- ~~transition_standard~~ - Already very fast at 14-18ns

### Potential Areas (Awaiting Full Results)

1. **Epsilon Closure**
   - Not yet benchmarked directly
   - Could be the heaviest operation in state transitions
   - Predicted: O(n √ó m) where n=positions, m=additions

2. **State Transition Overhead**
   - Full `transition_state()` not yet benchmarked
   - Includes epsilon closure + position transitions + State::insert
   - Expected to be slower than individual position transitions

3. **Algorithm Comparison**
   - Need to see if Transposition/MergeAndSplit are notably slower
   - Special position handling could add overhead

## Complexity Analysis Validation

### Theoretical vs Actual

| Operation | Theoretical | Measured | Status |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| characteristic_vector | O(k), k‚â§8 | 13-17ns | ‚úÖ Matches |
| index_of_match | O(k), k‚â§4 | 1.4-1.9ns | ‚úÖ Matches |
| transition_standard | O(k) | 14-18ns | ‚úÖ Matches |
| transition_state | O(n√ók√óm) | ‚è≥ Pending | - |
| epsilon_closure | O(n√óm) | ‚è≥ Pending | - |

Where:
- k = max_distance (typically ‚â§3)
- n = positions in state (typically 2-5)
- m = positions added per transition (typically 1-4)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚è≥ **Complete benchmarks** - Let full suite finish running
2. ‚è≥ **Analyze full results** - Run `python3 analyze_transition_results.py`
3. ‚è≥ **Generate flame graphs** - Resolve perf permission issues or use alternative profiling
4. ‚è≥ **Identify bottlenecks** - Based on complete benchmark data

### Decision Points

**IF** all transition functions are <50ns:
- **Conclusion**: Implementation is already near-optimal
- **Action**: Document the design, no code changes needed
- **Similar to**: Subsumption optimization outcome

**IF** state transition (transition_state) is >1¬µs:
- **Investigate**: epsilon_closure overhead
- **Investigate**: State::insert overhead (though likely optimal already)
- **Consider**: StatePool optimization impact

**IF** algorithm comparison shows >2x difference:
- **Investigate**: Special position handling overhead
- **Consider**: Algorithm-specific optimizations

## Preliminary Conclusion

Based on micro-benchmark results, the low-level primitive functions are **already highly optimized**:

- characteristic_vector: **13-17ns** ‚úÖ
- index_of_match: **1.4-1.9ns** ‚úÖ
- transition_standard: **14-18ns** ‚úÖ

This suggests that, like the subsumption optimization analysis, we may find that **the current implementation is already optimal** or very close to optimal.

The key question is: **What is the performance of full state transitions?**

If `transition_state()` is fast (e.g., <200ns for typical 3-position states), then there's likely nothing to optimize. The next bottleneck would be elsewhere in the system (dictionary traversal, result collection, etc.).
