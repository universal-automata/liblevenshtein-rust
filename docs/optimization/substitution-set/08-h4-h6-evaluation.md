# H4-H6 Optimization Evaluation

**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Status**: Evaluation phase - determining if pursuit is justified
**Baseline**: H1 + H3 (current optimized state)

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation**: ❌ **DO NOT PURSUE** H4-H6 at this time

**Rationale**:
1. **Diminishing returns**: Expected gains <3% vs already achieved 9-46%
2. **Complexity cost**: Platform-specific code, feature gating, maintenance burden
3. **Current state**: Already excellent performance with H1 + H3
4. **ROI insufficient**: Cost/benefit analysis strongly favors deferring

**Decision**: Keep H4-H6 deferred unless production profiling reveals new bottlenecks

---

## Current Performance Baseline (H1 + H3)

### Achieved Optimizations
- **H1**: 15-28% faster preset initialization
- **H3**: 9-46% faster for small sets, 50-79% memory reduction
- **Integration**: 84% of tests improved, zero critical regressions
- **Test Coverage**: All 509 tests passing

### Remaining Headroom

Based on crossover analysis and profiling:
- **Linear scan (1-3 pairs)**: Already optimal for this use case (cache-friendly sequential access)
- **Hash lookup (5+ pairs)**: FxHashSet is already highly optimized (~370ns constant time)
- **Preset initialization**: Const arrays eliminate most overhead (compile-time)

**Analysis**: Limited remaining headroom for further optimization without fundamental algorithm changes.

## H4: SIMD Lookup for Small Sets

### Hypothesis

For very small sets (≤8 pairs), SIMD parallel comparison using AVX2 instructions could outperform linear scan by checking multiple pairs simultaneously.

### Expected Impact

**Optimistic**: 1-3% improvement for 1-4 pair sets
**Realistic**: <1% improvement (likely within noise)

### Theoretical Analysis

**Current Performance** (H3 linear scan):
- 1 pair: 201.3ns (baseline = 376.7ns, 1.87× speedup already achieved)
- 2 pairs: 263.3ns (baseline = 366.8ns, 1.39× speedup)
- 3 pairs: 330.8ns (baseline = 363.6ns, 1.10× speedup)

**SIMD Potential**:
- AVX2 can process 4× u64 comparisons in parallel (256-bit registers)
- Each (u8, u8) pair = 16 bits → can fit 16 pairs in 256 bits
- **Problem**: Unpacking, shuffling, and comparison overhead

**Break-Even Analysis**:
```
Linear scan cost: N × 1.0ns per pair (sequential comparison)
SIMD setup cost: ~5-10ns (load, shuffle, prepare mask)
SIMD comparison: ~1-2ns (parallel compare + extract result)

For 1 pair: Linear = 1.0ns, SIMD = 7-12ns → Linear wins by 7-12×
For 4 pairs: Linear = 4.0ns, SIMD = 7-12ns → Linear still wins
For 8 pairs: Linear = 8.0ns, SIMD = 7-12ns → SIMD competitive at best
```

**Conclusion**: SIMD overhead likely negates any parallel benefit for small sets.

### Implementation Complexity

**Required Changes**:
- Platform detection (`cfg(target_feature = "avx2")`)
- SIMD intrinsics (`std::arch::x86_64`)
- Fallback implementation for non-AVX2 platforms
- Data layout changes (alignment, padding)
- Feature flag (`simd` feature already exists but unused)

**Code Complexity**: +150-200 LOC
**Maintenance Burden**: High (platform-specific, CPU feature detection)
**Testing Burden**: Multiple code paths (AVX2, SSE4.1, fallback)

### Cost/Benefit Analysis

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Expected Improvement | 40% | **1** | **0.4** | <1% realistic |
| Code Complexity | 20% | **1** | **0.2** | +150-200 LOC, platform-specific |
| Maintenance | 20% | **1** | **0.2** | High burden (multiple paths) |
| Testing | 10% | **2** | **0.2** | Need multi-platform CI |
| Portability | 10% | **1** | **0.1** | x86-64 only, feature detection |
| **Total** | **100%** | — | **1.1/5** | **REJECT** |

**Threshold for pursuit**: 3.0/5
**H4 score**: **1.1/5** → **Strong reject**

### Recommendation

❌ **DO NOT PURSUE H4**

**Rationale**:
1. Setup overhead likely exceeds parallel benefit for small sets
2. H3 linear scan already cache-optimal (sequential access)
3. Adds significant complexity for <1% realistic gain
4. Platform-specific code reduces portability
5. Not worth engineering effort given current excellent performance

## H5: Perfect Hashing for Presets

### Hypothesis

Compile-time perfect hash function for fixed presets eliminates runtime hash computation entirely, potentially faster than even const array initialization.

### Expected Impact

**Optimistic**: 1-2% improvement for preset initialization
**Realistic**: <0.5% improvement (likely within noise)

### Theoretical Analysis

**Current Performance** (H1 const arrays):
- phonetic_basic: 158ns (14 pairs)
- keyboard_qwerty: 495ns (68 pairs)
- leet_speak: 200ns (22 pairs)
- ocr_friendly: 160ns (18 pairs)

**Perfect Hashing Potential**:
- Eliminate FxHash computation (~3-5ns per pair)
- Compile-time hash table generation
- O(1) lookup with zero collisions

**Best-Case Savings**:
```
phonetic_basic: 14 pairs × 3ns = 42ns saved → 158ns - 42ns = 116ns (26% gain)
keyboard_qwerty: 68 pairs × 3ns = 204ns saved → 495ns - 204ns = 291ns (41% gain)
```

**Reality Check**:
- H1 already uses direct byte insertion (`allow_byte()` vs `allow()`)
- Const arrays pre-allocate exact capacity
- Most initialization cost is memory allocation, not hashing
- Perfect hash table still requires allocation + initialization

**Realistic Savings**: <10% of initialization time → <1% end-to-end

### Implementation Complexity

**Required Tools**:
- Build-time perfect hash generation (phf crate)
- Code generation in build.rs
- Const generic perfect hash functions
- Integration with existing preset definitions

**Code Complexity**: +100-150 LOC (build.rs + codegen)
**Build-Time Cost**: Increased compile time
**Maintenance Burden**: Medium (build-time dependencies)

### Critical Issue: Initialization Still Required

**Problem**: Perfect hash only optimizes **lookup**, not **initialization**

```rust
// Current (H1):
const PHONETIC_PAIRS: &[(u8, u8)] = &[...];
SubstitutionSet::from_pairs(PHONETIC_PAIRS);  // 158ns

// Perfect hash (H5):
const PHONETIC_HASH: PerfectHashMap<(u8, u8), ()> = ...;
// Still need to convert to SubstitutionSet → same initialization cost!
```

**Conclusion**: Perfect hashing doesn't address the right bottleneck. Initialization cost dominates, not lookup during init.

### Cost/Benefit Analysis

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Expected Improvement | 40% | **1** | **0.4** | <0.5% realistic |
| Code Complexity | 20% | **2** | **0.4** | Build-time codegen |
| Maintenance | 20% | **2** | **0.4** | phf dependency |
| Build-Time Cost | 10% | **2** | **0.2** | Increased compile time |
| Applicability | 10% | **2** | **0.2** | Presets only (not user sets) |
| **Total** | **100%** | — | **1.6/5** | **REJECT** |

**Threshold for pursuit**: 3.0/5
**H5 score**: **1.6/5** → **Reject**

### Recommendation

❌ **DO NOT PURSUE H5**

**Rationale**:
1. Doesn't address initialization bottleneck (memory allocation dominates)
2. H1 already eliminates most overhead with const arrays
3. <1% realistic gain for significant build-time complexity
4. Only applies to presets (not user-defined sets)
5. phf dependency adds maintenance burden

## H6: Custom Hasher Optimization

### Hypothesis

Specialized hasher for (u8, u8) pairs could reduce collisions and improve performance over general-purpose FxHasher.

### Expected Impact

**Optimistic**: 1-2% improvement for hash-based lookups
**Realistic**: <0.5% improvement (FxHasher already excellent for small keys)

### Theoretical Analysis

**Current Performance** (FxHashSet with FxHasher):
- Hash lookup: ~370ns (constant across 5-20 pairs)
- FxHasher: Optimized for small keys, very low collision rate

**Custom Hasher Potential**:
- (u8, u8) = 16 bits → trivial to hash
- Could use simple XOR or multiply-shift
- Perfect hashing possible for small domains

**Best-Case Savings**:
```
FxHash computation: ~3-5ns
Custom hash: ~1-2ns
Savings: ~2-3ns per lookup

For typical query (100 lookups):
Current: 100 × 5ns = 500ns
Optimized: 100 × 3ns = 300ns
Savings: 200ns (40% of hash time)

But hash time is only part of total query time!
Total query time: ~10-50µs
Hash savings: 200ns = 0.2-2% of total
```

**Conclusion**: Hash computation is tiny fraction of total query time.

### Implementation Complexity

**Required Changes**:
```rust
struct PairHasher;

impl Hasher for PairHasher {
    fn write(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) { /* custom logic */ }
    fn write_u16(&mut self, i: u16) { /* optimized for (u8, u8) */ }
    fn finish(&self) -> u64 { /* return hash */ }
}

impl BuildHasher for PairHasherBuilder {
    type Hasher = PairHasher;
    fn build_hasher(&self) -> Self::Hasher { /* ... */ }
}

// Usage:
FxHashSet::with_hasher(PairHasherBuilder);
```

**Code Complexity**: +50-100 LOC
**Maintenance Burden**: Medium (custom hasher logic)
**Testing Burden**: Need collision testing, distribution analysis

### Critical Issue: FxHasher Already Excellent

**FxHasher Characteristics**:
- Designed for small keys (exactly our use case)
- Very fast (~3-5ns for small keys)
- Low collision rate
- Well-tested, production-proven

**Custom Hasher Challenges**:
- Hard to beat FxHasher for 16-bit keys
- Risk of worse collision behavior
- Need extensive testing/validation
- Maintenance burden for marginal gain

### Cost/Benefit Analysis

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Expected Improvement | 40% | **1** | **0.4** | <0.5% end-to-end |
| Code Complexity | 20% | **3** | **0.6** | +50-100 LOC, but straightforward |
| Maintenance | 20% | **2** | **0.4** | Custom hasher logic |
| Testing | 10% | **2** | **0.2** | Need collision analysis |
| Risk | 10% | **2** | **0.2** | Worse collisions possible |
| **Total** | **100%** | — | **1.8/5** | **REJECT** |

**Threshold for pursuit**: 3.0/5
**H6 score**: **1.8/5** → **Reject**

### Recommendation

❌ **DO NOT PURSUE H6**

**Rationale**:
1. FxHasher already excellent for small keys
2. Hash time is tiny fraction of total query time (<2%)
3. Risk of worse collision behavior
4. Hard to beat well-tested production hasher
5. <0.5% realistic end-to-end gain

## Decision: Defer H4-H6 Indefinitely

### Rationale

1. **Excellent Current State**
   - H1 + H3 deliver 9-46% improvements
   - Zero critical regressions
   - All tests passing
   - Production-ready

2. **Diminishing Returns**
   - H4-H6 expected gains: <3% combined
   - Already achieved major wins (15-46%)
   - Limited remaining headroom

3. **Cost/Benefit**
   - All H4-H6 score below 2.0/5 (threshold: 3.0/5)
   - High complexity for minimal gain
   - Maintenance burden not justified

4. **Better Alternatives**
   - Monitor production metrics
   - Profile real-world usage patterns
   - Address actual bottlenecks if they emerge
   - Consider algorithmic changes if needed (not micro-optimizations)

### Conditions for Reconsidering

H4-H6 should ONLY be reconsidered if:

1. **Production profiling reveals**:
   - SubstitutionSet is >20% of total query time
   - Users demand sub-nanosecond latency
   - Specific use cases justify SIMD/perfect-hash complexity

2. **Substantial resources available**:
   - Dedicated optimization team
   - Cross-platform CI infrastructure
   - Budget for extensive testing/validation

3. **New algorithmic insights**:
   - Better SIMD approach discovered
   - Zero-overhead perfect hashing technique
   - Hash function breakthrough

**Current Status**: None of these conditions are met → **DEFER INDEFINITELY**

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Deploy H1 + H3 to production** - Both optimizations ready
2. ✅ **Monitor real-world metrics** - Validate improvements in production
3. ✅ **Archive H4-H6 analysis** - Document for future reference
4. ✅ **Close optimization project** - Declare success

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Production Monitoring**
   - Track query latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
   - Measure actual substitution set size distribution
   - Profile real-world workloads

2. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Only optimize based on production evidence
   - Focus on actual bottlenecks (not speculative)
   - Data-driven decision making

3. **Algorithmic Innovation**
   - Consider fundamentally different approaches if needed
   - Research literature for new algorithms
   - Collaborate with performance experts if justified

---

## Conclusion

The SubstitutionSet optimization project has successfully delivered two production-ready optimizations (H1, H3) with 9-46% improvements. Further micro-optimizations (H4-H6) are not justified given:

1. **Insufficient ROI**: <3% expected gains for significant complexity
2. **Excellent current state**: Already achieved major wins
3. **Better alternatives**: Monitor production, address real bottlenecks

**Final Decision**: ❌ **DEFER H4-H6 INDEFINITELY**

**Status**: Optimization project **COMPLETE** - Mission accomplished with H1 + H3 ✅
