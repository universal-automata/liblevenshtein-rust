## Key Theorems

### Determinism

**Theorem (Lexical Determinism)**: Levenshtein automaton construction is deterministic. Query is deterministic with lexicographic tie-breaking.

**Theorem (Grammar Non-Determinism)**: BFS grammar correction is non-deterministic for ambiguous grammars or without tie-breaking rules.

**Theorem (Type Inference Determinism)**: Algorithm W (Hindley-Milner) is deterministic with deterministic fresh variable generation.

**Theorem (Feedback Breaks Determinism)**: Feedback mechanism breaks determinism unless feedback updates are deterministic.

### Correctness

**Theorem (Levenshtein Correctness)**: Levenshtein automaton correctly recognizes all and only strings within distance d.

**Theorem (Grammar Correctness)**: All parse trees returned by BFS are syntactically valid (in ParseTree(G)).

**Theorem (Type Safety)**: Well-typed programs satisfy Progress and Preservation (don't go wrong).

**Theorem (Session Type Safety)**: Well-typed processes with dual session types are deadlock-free and communication-safe.

**Theorem (Compositional Correctness)**: If each layer is correct, the composition is correct.

### Optimality

**Theorem (Top-k Optimality)**: Lexical correction returns k closest dictionary words (per-token optimal).

**Theorem (BFS Optimality)**: BFS finds minimum-distance parse tree for **uniform edit costs**.

**Theorem (BFS Non-Optimality)**: BFS does **not** guarantee optimality for **non-uniform costs**. Use Dijkstra's algorithm instead.

**Theorem (Beam Search Non-Optimality)**: Beam search does **not** guarantee optimality even for uniform costs.

**Theorem (Non-Compositional Optimality)**: Optimal layers do **not** compose to optimal pipeline. Sequential composition is globally suboptimal.

**Theorem (Repair Undecidability)**: Semantic optimal repair is **undecidable** (by reduction from Rice's Theorem).

**Theorem (Joint Optimization Intractability)**: Joint optimization over all layers is **intractable** (exponential search space).

### Complexity

**Theorem (Lexical Complexity)**: O(n × d) construction, O(|V|) query per word, O(n × d) space.

**Theorem (Grammar Complexity - Pure BFS)**: O(|Grammar|^d × n × p) worst-case (exponential in d).

**Theorem (Grammar Complexity - Beam BFS)**: O(k × d × n × p) (tractable for k = 20-100).

**Theorem (Type Inference Complexity)**: O(n log n) average case, exponential worst case (rare in practice).

**Theorem (SMT Repair Complexity)**: MaxSMT is NP-hard.

**Theorem (Session Types Complexity)**: O(n) for linear session types, O(n^k) for non-linear.

### Decidability

**Theorem (Regular Language Decidability)**: Lexical correction is decidable (finite automata).

**Theorem (CFG Parsing Decidability)**: Grammar correction is decidable (O(n³) worst-case parsing).

**Theorem (Type Inference Decidability)**: Hindley-Milner type inference is decidable (Algorithm W always terminates).

**Theorem (SMT Decidability)**: MaxSMT is undecidable in general but decidable for many practical theories (linear arithmetic, uninterpreted functions).

**Theorem (Session Type Decidability)**: Session type checking is decidable for finite session types and bounded processes.

**Theorem (π-Calculus Undecidability)**: Behavioral equivalence for full π-calculus is undecidable.

## Counter-Examples

### CE 1: Lexical Non-Determinism
```
Input: "teh", d=1, k=1
Dictionary: {tea, ten, the}
All have distance 1
Without tie-breaking: could return any of {tea, ten, the}
```

### CE 2: Grammar Ambiguity
```python
Grammar: Expr → Expr + Expr | Expr * Expr | number
Input: "1 + 2 3" (missing operator)
Corrections (both cost 1):
  - Insert '+': "1 + 2 + 3"
  - Insert '*': "1 + 2 * 3"
BFS may return either depending on exploration order
```

### CE 3: Sequential Composition Suboptimality
```
Input: "prnt(x + y" (missing ')', typo in 'print')

Sequential (layer-wise optimal):
  Layer 1: "prnt" → "print" (cost 1)
  Layer 2: Insert ')' (cost 1)
  Total: 2

Joint optimization:
  Keep "prnt", insert ')' (cost 1)
  If "prnt" is user-defined, this is valid with total cost 1 < 2
```

### CE 4: Semantic Repair Incorrectness
```python
Original intent:
  balance: Int = 100
  withdraw(amount: Int): balance = balance - amount

Buggy code:
  balance: Int = 100
  withdraw(amount: String): balance = balance - amount  # Type error

SMT repair (type-correct but semantically wrong):
  balance: String = "100"  # Changed wrong variable!
  withdraw(amount: String): balance = balance - amount
```

## Practical Recommendations

### To Achieve Determinism

1. **Lexical**: Use lexicographic tie-breaking, sort candidates
2. **Grammar**: Use FIFO queue, deterministic tie-breaking, fixed exploration order
3. **Semantic**: Counter-based fresh variables, deterministic SMT solver (set seed)
4. **Feedback**: Disable for deterministic mode OR use fixed training data

### To Maximize Correctness

1. **Lexical**: Validated dictionary, no invalid entries
2. **Grammar**: Filter out parse trees with error nodes
3. **Semantic**: Double-check well-typedness after repair
4. **Process**: Use proven-correct session type checker
5. **Testing**: Extensive property-based testing

### To Approximate Optimality

1. **Beam Search**: Use k=20 (interactive) or k=100 (batch), adaptive beam width
2. **Heuristics**: A* with admissible heuristics, language model scores
3. **Multi-Objective**: Compute Pareto frontier, present multiple options
4. **Feedback**: Train ranking model on correction corpus, online learning
5. **Non-Uniform Costs**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm instead of BFS

### Performance Targets

```
Layer 1 (Lexical):       50ms  (10 tokens × 5ms)
Layer 2 (Grammar):      200ms  (beam search)
Layer 3 (Validation):    50ms  (type check 20 candidates)
Layer 4 (Repair):       100ms  (if needed)
Layer 5 (Verification):  50ms  (session types)
-------------------------------------------------
Total:                  450ms  (acceptable for IDE)
```
