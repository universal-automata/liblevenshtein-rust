## Performance Characteristics

**Contextual Completion Engine** (Zipper-based):
- Insert character: ~4 µs (12 M chars/sec)
- Checkpoint: ~116 ns per operation
- Query (500 terms, distance 1): ~11.5 µs
- Query (distance 2): ~309 µs
- Thread-safe, hierarchical context support

**Simple Fuzzy Matching** (Node-based):
- Query (distance 1): ~53 µs (1.88× faster)
- Query (distance 2): ~156 µs (1.97× faster)
- Best for single-dictionary, high-throughput scenarios
