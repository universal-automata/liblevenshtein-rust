## Notes and Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **Character-level rollback**: Use VecDeque<char> for O(1) push/pop
- **Checkpoints**: Store (position, context) snapshots
- **Hierarchical visibility**: Child contexts see parent drafts via ContextTree
- **Lock strategy**: Lock-per-operation for PathMap, DashMap for drafts
- **Backend targets**: PathMapDictionary (primary), DoubleArrayTrie (deferred - read-only)
- **Zipper nomenclature**: Use `DictZipper` prefix to distinguish from future AutomatonZipper, IntersectionZipper, etc.
- **PathMapZipper design**: Arc<Vec<u8>> for paths (cheap cloning), lock-per-operation pattern for concurrency

### Implementation Notes (Phase 1)
- PathMap's `ByteMask` requires `use pathmap::utils::BitMask` trait to access `test_bit()` method
- PathMapDictionary's `map` field made `pub(crate)` to allow zipper access
- Slices don't have `clone()` - use `.to_vec()` instead
- All zipper examples marked as `ignore` in doctests since they require feature flags

### Implementation Notes (Phase 2)
- Added `CharUnit` bound to `DictZipper::Unit` trait to support PathNode requirements
- IntersectionZipper constrained to `D: DictZipper<Unit = u8>` to match AutomatonZipper's byte operations
- Fixed depth calculation: PathNode already includes current label in depth, no need to add 1
- Zipper `children()` method clones automaton before closure to avoid borrowing self
- Test pattern: collect children into Vec before iteration to avoid borrow-while-mutate errors
- Distance calculation: `infer_distance(term_length)` returns distance for matched portion only, not including unmatched query suffix
- Benchmark shows zipper ~2x slower for fuzzy queries due to zipper creation overhead and BFS queue management

### Implementation Notes (Phase 3)
- DraftBuffer uses VecDeque<char> for O(1) insert/delete at the end (simulating cursor at end of buffer)
- Checkpoints are lightweight (8 bytes) storing only position, not full content
- Checkpoint undo pattern: pop current checkpoint, peek previous checkpoint, restore to previous
- Redo would require storing full buffer content at each checkpoint (too heavy), so only undo is supported
- ContextTree uses HashMap<ContextId, Option<ContextId>> for efficient parent lookup
- `visible_contexts()` walks up parent chain to return all visible scopes
- `remove()` recursively removes descendants to maintain tree integrity
- Integration tests verify Unicode support (emoji and multi-byte characters work correctly)
- `depth()` returns `Option<usize>` (None if context doesn't exist)

### Open Questions
- Should we add a `root_zipper()` convenience method to PathMapDictionary? (Can be added later)

## Post-Completion Optimization Work

### Zipper Performance Optimization (2025-11-03)

**Objective:** Optimize zipper-based operations for better performance in contextual completion queries.

**Optimizations Implemented:**
1. **Copy-on-Write (COW) Path Storage** - Changed `Arc<Vec<u8>>` to `Arc<[u8]>` in PathMapZipper
2. **Lock Batching** - Reduced lock acquisitions in `PathMapZipper::children()` from O(n) to O(1)
3. **Inline Hints** - Added `#[inline]` to hot path methods

**Performance Results:**
- Insert character throughput: **+4-6% improvement** (11.0-12.2 M chars/sec)
- Checkpoint operations: **+8.22% improvement** (126 ns → 116 ns)
- Query (500 terms): **+6.39% improvement** (12.23 µs → 11.45 µs)
- Overall: **3-9% improvements** across most operations

**Documentation:**
- Detailed report: `/tmp/final_optimization_report.md`
- Baseline metrics: `/tmp/zipper_optimization_baseline.md`

### Zipper vs Node-Based Performance Comparison (2025-11-03)

**Benchmark Results:**

| Edit Distance | Node-Based | Zipper-Based | Overhead |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Distance 0 | 9.56 µs | 15.94 µs | +66.7% |
| Distance 1 | 53.25 µs | 100.14 µs | +88.1% |
| Distance 2 | 156.46 µs | 309.00 µs | +97.5% |

**Analysis:**
- Zipper-based queries are **1.66-1.97× slower** than node-based
- This is an **intentional architectural trade-off**
- Absolute performance is still excellent (<1ms queries)
- Zippers provide essential features for contextual completion:
  - Hierarchical context support
  - Thread safety by design
  - Compositional architecture
  - Draft + finalized term mixing
  - Immutable, functional traversal

**Recommendation:** Use zipper-based for contextual completion (primary use case) and node-based for simple, high-throughput fuzzy matching.
