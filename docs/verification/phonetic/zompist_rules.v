(** * Zompist English Spelling-to-Pronunciation Rules

    Implementation of the 56 spelling rules from https://zompist.com/spell.html

    These rules transform English orthography to a phonetic representation.
    The rules must be applied in order (1-56) as some rules depend on
    transformations made by earlier rules.
