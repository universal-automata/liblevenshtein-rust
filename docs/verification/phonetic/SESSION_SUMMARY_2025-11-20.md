## Detailed Progress

### Axiom 2: Pattern Overlap Preservation ✅

**Starting State**: Theorem with 97% completion, 1 admit at line 2685

**Work Done**:
1. Added `leftmost_mismatch_before_transformation` helper lemma (194 lines)
   - **Location**: Lines 2354-2548
   - **Proof Strategy**: Contradiction + induction on pattern structure
   - **Key Insight**: If leftmost mismatch were at/after transformation point, we'd have unchanged matching prefix that contradicts pattern failing

2. Applied helper to resolve admit (Line 2701-2709)
   - Simple application with 6 explicit premises
   - Clean resolution of the 3% gap

3. Changed theorem conclusion from `Admitted` to `Qed` (Line 2817)

**Result**: **100% COMPLETE** - Fully proven theorem!

**Proof Statistics**:
- Total lines: 418 (theorem) + 194 (helper) = 612 lines
- Cases proven: All context types + all mismatch cases
- Final status: Qed ✓

---

### Axiom 1: Algorithm Execution Semantics ⚠️

**Starting State**: Pure axiom, no proof infrastructure

**Work Done**:
1. Defined `AlgoState` inductive relation (Lines 1841-1863)
   - Models algorithm execution state
   - Three constructors: init, step_no_match, step_match_restart
   - Tracks invariant throughout execution

2. Proved `algo_state_maintains_invariant` (Lines 1866-1887)
   - Theorem with Qed ✓
   - Shows AlgoState maintains no_rules_match_before
   - Simple proof by induction on AlgoState

3. Added `find_first_match_implies_algo_state` (Lines 1889-1923)
   - **Status**: Admitted
   - **Challenge**: Semantic gap - find_first_match only knows about one rule
   - **Documentation**: Detailed comments explaining the limitation

4. Critical Analysis
   - Identified that original Axiom 1 statement is logically invalid
   - Documented counter-example in AXIOM1_CRITICAL_ANALYSIS.md
   - Explained why it cannot be proven without execution trace

**Result**: **50% COMPLETE** - Execution model defined, core gap documented

## Scientific Findings

### Axiom 2 Resolution

**Key Technique**: Proof by contradiction on leftmost mismatch position

**Insight**: When a pattern has a leftmost mismatch:
- All earlier positions match successfully
- These matching positions are in the unchanged region (< pos)
- If leftmost mismatch were >= pos, we'd have a matching prefix that's unchanged
- But pattern fails overall → contradiction
- Therefore leftmost mismatch must be < pos

**Applicability**: This technique applies to any pattern matching preservation problem where:
- Pattern extends across a transformation boundary
- Transformation preserves regions before the transformation point
- Pattern matching is left-to-right sequential

### Axiom 1 Semantic Boundary

**Finding**: There's a fundamental distinction between:
1. **Single-rule properties** (provable from find_first_match)
   - Example: Rule r doesn't match before position pos
   - Derivable from find_first_match r s = Some pos

2. **Multi-rule execution properties** (require execution context)
   - Example: No rules in list match before position pos
   - Requires knowing rules were checked sequentially in algorithm

**Implication**: The axiom captures algorithm execution semantics, not just function behavior.

**Path Forward**:
- Option A: Model full execution trace (20-40h)
- Option B: Reformulate with explicit execution context (8-12h)
- Option C: Accept as semantic axiom with documented property

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic approach**: Breaking down the problem into helper lemmas
2. **Proof by contradiction**: Effective for the mismatch positioning problem
3. **Documentation**: Clear analysis of gaps enabled efficient decision-making
4. **Testing**: Continuous validation ensured no regressions

### What Was Challenging
1. **Induction complexity**: Pattern induction required careful case analysis
2. **Compilation time**: Large proofs take 2-3 minutes to compile
3. **Semantic gap**: Axiom 1 cannot be proven without execution modeling
4. **Critical analysis**: Discovering original axiom statement was invalid

### Recommendations for Similar Projects
1. **Start with gap analysis**: Understand what's provable before attempting
2. **Build execution models early**: If algorithm semantics are needed
3. **Use contradiction proofs**: Effective for "must be before" properties
4. **Document findings**: Even negative results provide value
5. **Test continuously**: Catch issues early
