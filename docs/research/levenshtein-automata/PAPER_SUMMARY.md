## Chapter 1: Introduction and Motivation

**Pages**: 5-7

### Problem Context

Finding correction candidates for garbled input words appears in numerous applications:

1. **Spelling Correction**: User types "recieve" → suggest "receive"
2. **OCR Recognition**: Scanner reads "1" as "l" or "I"
3. **Speech Recognition**: Phonetic input matches dictionary words
4. **Internet/Bibliographic Search**: Handle typos in queries
5. **DNA Sequence Matching**: Allow for mutations/errors

### Existing Approaches

**Dictionary Partitioning Methods**:
- Divide dictionary into blocks based on word properties (length, first letter, etc.)
- Compute Levenshtein distance only within relevant blocks
- **Problem**: Still requires O(|block| × |W| × |V|) distance computations

**Oflazer's Approach** (1996):
- Use finite state transducers to represent edit operations
- More general but can be slower for simple Levenshtein distance

### Proposed Solutions

This paper presents **two methods** based on Levenshtein automata:

**Method 1: Explicit Construction** (Chapter 3-5)
- Build deterministic automaton LEV_n(W) that accepts exactly L_Lev(n,W)
- Traverse dictionary and automaton in parallel
- Construction in O(|W|) time for fixed n

**Method 2: Imitation** (Chapter 6)
- Avoid building LEV_n(W) explicitly
- Use precomputed table T_n to simulate automaton behavior
- Generate states on-demand during traversal

### Key Advantage

**Amortized Efficiency**: Once LEV_n(W) is constructed (or simulated), finding all matching dictionary words requires only O(|D|) time where |D| is dictionary size (measured as total edges in trie representation).

### Extensions Discussed

The paper shows how to extend the approach to handle additional edit operations:
- **Transposition** (Chapter 7): Swapping adjacent characters
- **Merge and Split** (Chapter 8): Two characters ↔ one character

---

## Chapter 2: Formal Preliminaries

**Pages**: 9-12

### Finite State Automata

**Definition 2.0.0**: A finite state automaton A = (Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F) where:
- Q: finite set of states
- Σ: alphabet
- δ: Q × Σ → Q (transition function)
- q₀ ∈ Q: initial state
- F ⊆ Q: set of final states

**Language**: L(A) = {w ∈ Σ* | δ*(q₀, w) ∈ F}

### Levenshtein Distance

**Definition 2.0.1**: The Levenshtein distance d_L(W,V) between words W and V is the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions needed to transform W into V.

**Recursive Definition**:
```
d_L(ε, W) = |W|
d_L(V, ε) = |V|
d_L(aV, bW) = d_L(V,W)                           if a = b
d_L(aV, bW) = 1 + min(d_L(V,W),                 if a ≠ b
                       d_L(aV,W),   # deletion
                       d_L(V,bW))   # insertion
```

**Example**:
```
d_L("kitten", "sitting") = 3
  kitten → sitten  (substitute k→s)
  sitten → sittin  (substitute e→i)
  sittin → sitting (insert g)
```

### Wagner-Fisher Algorithm

**Classical Dynamic Programming Approach**:

Compute matrix M where M[i,j] = d_L(W[1:i], V[1:j]):

```
M[0,j] = j  for all j
M[i,0] = i  for all i

M[i,j] = M[i-1,j-1]                               if W[i] = V[j]
M[i,j] = 1 + min(M[i-1,j-1],  # substitution
                  M[i-1,j],    # deletion
                  M[i,j-1])    # insertion       if W[i] ≠ V[j]
```

**Complexity**: O(|W| × |V|) time and space

**Problem**: For large dictionaries, computing this for every word is expensive.

### Trace Representation

**Definition**: A trace is a graphical representation of an edit sequence as a path in the |W| × |V| grid.

**Example**: For W = "ab", V = "aab":
```
    a  a  b
  +--+--+--+
a |  |  |  |  
  +--+--+--+
b |  |  |  |
  +--+--+--+
```

Path from (0,0) to (2,3) represents edit sequence:
- Match 'a' (diagonal)
- Insert 'a' (horizontal)
- Match 'b' (diagonal)

### Key Lemma

**Lemma 2.0.2**: If W = UW' and V = UV' (same prefix U), then:
```
d_L(V,W) = d_L(V',W')
```

**Significance**: Distance depends only on suffixes after common prefix. This enables incremental computation during dictionary traversal.

---

## Chapter 3: String Correction with Levenshtein-Automata

**Pages**: 13-14

### Levenshtein Language

**Definition 3.0.4**: For word W and error bound n:
```
L_Lev(n,W) = {V ∈ Σ* | d_L(W,V) ≤ n}
```

The set of all words within Levenshtein distance n from W.

### Levenshtein Automaton

**Definition 3.0.5**: A **Levenshtein automaton of degree n for W** is any finite state automaton A such that:
```
L(A) = L_Lev(n,W)
```

**Note**: Many automata could satisfy this definition. The paper constructs a specific deterministic one.

### Correction Algorithm

**Input**: 
- Dictionary automaton A^D = (Q^D, Σ, δ^D, q₀^D, F^D)
- Levenshtein automaton A^W = (Q^W, Σ, δ^W, q₀^W, F^W) for query word W

**Algorithm**: Parallel traversal with backtracking

```
Initialize: stack = [(ε, q₀^D, q₀^W)]

While stack not empty:
    Pop (V, q^D, q^W)
    
    For each x ∈ Σ:
        q₁^D := δ^D(q^D, x)
        q₁^W := δ^W(q^W, x)
        
        If q₁^D ≠ NIL and q₁^W ≠ NIL:
            V₁ := concat(V, x)
            Push (V₁, q₁^D, q₁^W)
            
            If (q₁^D ∈ F^D) and (q₁^W ∈ F^W):
                Output V₁  # Found matching word
```

**Complexity**: 
- O(|W|) to construct A^W (proven in Chapter 5)
- O(|D|) for parallel traversal where |D| = number of edges in dictionary

**Key Insight**: The automaton guides the search, avoiding distance computation for each dictionary word.

---

## Chapter 4: A Family of Deterministic Levenshtein-Automata

**Pages**: 15-26

This is the **core theoretical chapter** defining the construction of LEV_n(W).

### 4.1: Profile Sequences

**Definition 4.0.6**: For word U = z₁...z_u, the **profile** Pr(U) is a sequence ⟨n₁,...,n_u⟩ where:
- n₁ := 1
- For k > 1:
  - n_{k+1} := n_i if z_{k+1} = z_i for some i ≤ k (character seen before)
  - n_{k+1} := max{n_i | 1 ≤ i ≤ k} + 1 otherwise (new character)

**Example**:
```
U = "hello"
Pr("hello") = ⟨1, 2, 3, 3, 4⟩
  h → 1 (first unique)
  e → 2 (second unique)
  l → 3 (third unique)
  l → 3 (repeat of 'l')
  o → 4 (fourth unique)
```

**Purpose**: Encodes character repetition structure, used to define k-profiles.

### 4.2: k-Profile Sequences

**Definition 4.0.8**: For word U and integer k ≥ 0, the **k-profile** Pr_k(U) is the sequence Pr(U)[1:min(k,|U|)].

**Significance**: k-profiles characterize the "relevant" structure of a word for distance bound n.

### 4.3: Characteristic Vectors

**Definition 4.0.10**: For character x and word V = y₁...y_v, the **characteristic vector** χ(x,V) is the bit-vector ⟨b₁,...,b_v⟩ where:
```
b_j = 1  if y_j = x
b_j = 0  if y_j ≠ x
```

**Example**:
```
χ('l', "hello") = ⟨0,0,1,1,0⟩
χ('o', "hello") = ⟨0,0,0,0,1⟩
χ('x', "hello") = ⟨0,0,0,0,0⟩
```

**Purpose**: Determines which transitions are possible from a position under input character x.

### 4.4: Positions

**Definition 4.0.12**: A **position** is an expression i#e where:
- 0 ≤ i ≤ |W| (index into input word W)
- 0 ≤ e ≤ n (error count)

**Intuition**: Position i#e represents "having matched i characters of W with e errors accumulated".

**Examples** for W = "hello", n = 2:
- 0#0: Start position (no characters matched, no errors)
- 3#1: Matched 3 characters with 1 error
- 5#0: Matched all 5 characters with 0 errors (perfect match)
- 5#2: Matched all 5 characters with 2 errors

### 4.5: Language of a Position

**Proposition 4.0.31**: For position π = i#e:
```
L({i#e}) = L_Lev(n-e, W[i+1:|W|])
```

**Interpretation**: From position i#e, we can accept words within distance n-e from the suffix of W starting at position i+1.

**Example**: For W = "hello", n = 2:
- L({3#1}) = L_Lev(1, "lo") = {lo, llo, o, l, lol, loo, ...}

### 4.6: Subsumption

**Definition 4.0.15**: Position i#e **subsumes** position j#f (written i#e ⊑ j#f) if:
1. e < f (strictly fewer errors), AND
2. |j-i| ≤ f-e (j is reachable from i within error budget)

**Lemma 4.0.17**: If i#e ⊑ j#f, then L({j#f}) ⊆ L({i#e}).

**Significance**: If π subsumes π', then π' is redundant (any word accepted from π' is also accepted from π).

**Example**: For n = 2:
- 3#0 ⊑ 4#1? Check: 0 < 1 ✓ and |4-3| = 1 ≤ 1-0 = 1 ✓ → YES
- 3#1 ⊑ 3#2? Check: 1 < 2 ✓ and |3-3| = 0 ≤ 2-1 = 1 ✓ → YES
- 3#1 ⊑ 5#2? Check: 1 < 2 ✓ and |5-3| = 2 ≤ 2-1 = 1 ✗ → NO

### 4.7: Relevant Subword

**Definition 4.0.16**: For position π = i#e, the **relevant subword** W[π] is:
```
W[π] = W[i+1:i+k]  where k = min(n-e+1, |W|-i)
```

**Purpose**: Only this subword affects transition behavior from π (characters beyond k cannot be reached with remaining error budget).

### 4.8: States

**Definition 4.0.18**: A **state** is a set M of positions with the following properties:
1. **Base position**: Contains exactly one position i#0 (called the base)
2. **No subsumption**: No position in M subsumes another position in M
3. **Reachability**: All positions in M are "reachable" from the base position

**Example states** for W = "hello", n = 1:
- {0#0}: Initial state
- {2#0, 2#1, 3#1}: State with base at index 2
- {5#0}: Final state (matched all of W with 0 errors)
- {5#1}: Final state (matched all of W with 1 error)

**Non-example**:
- {2#0, 2#1, 2#0}: Invalid (duplicate position)
- {2#0, 3#0}: Invalid (two base positions)
- {2#0, 4#1}: Invalid (4#1 not reachable from 2#0 with budget 1)

### 4.9: Elementary Transitions

**Definition 4.0.24**: For position π = i#e and character x, the **elementary transition** δ(π,x) is the set of positions reachable from π by reading x.

**Table 4.1: Elementary Transition Rules**

Let π = i#e and χ(x, W[π]) = ⟨b₁,...,b_k⟩ where k = min(n-e+1, |W|-i).

**Case 1**: b₁ = 1 (first character of W[π] matches x)
```
δ(π,x) = {(i+1)#e}
```
→ Match without error

**Case 2**: b₁ = 0, but b_j = 1 for some j > 1 (match later in W[π])
```
δ(π,x) = {i#(e+1), (i+1)#(e+1), (i+j)#(e+j-1)}
```
→ Three options:
  - i#(e+1): Insert x (don't advance in W)
  - (i+1)#(e+1): Delete W[i+1] (advance in W, not in input)
  - (i+j)#(e+j-1): Substitute W[i+1:i+j-1] for x, match W[i+j]

**Case 3**: All b_j = 0 (no match in W[π])
```
δ(π,x) = {i#(e+1), (i+1)#(e+1)}
```
→ Two options:
  - i#(e+1): Insert x
  - (i+1)#(e+1): Substitute W[i+1] for x (or delete W[i+1] + insert x)

**Example**: W = "hello", π = 2#0 (base at index 2), n = 2

W[π] = "llo" (relevant subword: up to 3 characters since n-e+1 = 3)

- δ(2#0, 'l'): χ('l', "llo") = ⟨1,1,0⟩ → Case 1 → {3#0}
- δ(2#0, 'o'): χ('o', "llo") = ⟨0,0,1⟩ → Case 2 (j=3) → {2#1, 3#1, 5#2}
- δ(2#0, 'x'): χ('x', "llo") = ⟨0,0,0⟩ → Case 3 → {2#1, 3#1}

### 4.10: State Transitions

**Definition 4.0.28**: For state M and character x, the **state transition** Δ(M,x) is:
```
Δ(M,x) = ⊔_{π∈M} δ(π,x)
```

where ⊔ is the **join operation**: union of sets, then remove subsumed positions.

**Example**: M = {2#0, 3#1}, x = 'l', W = "hello", n = 2

```
δ(2#0, 'l') = {3#0}         (from above)
δ(3#1, 'l') = {4#1}         (W[3+1] = 'l', matches)

Δ(M, 'l') = {3#0, 4#1}      (union, no subsumption)
```

### 4.11: Raised Positions and States

**Definition 4.0.26**: For position i#e and integer k ≥ 0:
```
[i#e]↑k = (i+k)#(e+k)
```

For state M = {i#0, π₁,...,π_m}:
```
[M]↑k = {(i+k)#0, [π₁]↑k,...,[π_m]↑k}
```

**Raising Lemma 4.0.27**: For n > 0 and 1 ≤ e ≤ n:
```
δ^(n)([π]↑e, x) = [δ^(n-e)(π, x)]↑e
```

**Significance**: Transitions for raised positions can be computed from lower-degree automata. This enables recursive construction of tables for higher degrees.

### 4.12: LEV_n(W) Definition

**Definition 4.0.28**: The **Levenshtein automaton of degree n for W** is LEV_n(W) = (Q, Σ, Δ, q₀, F) where:

- **Q**: Set of all valid states
- **Σ**: Alphabet
- **Δ**: State transition function (as defined above)
- **q₀** = {0#0}: Initial state
- **F**: Set of all states M such that M ∩ {i#e | i = |W|, 0 ≤ e ≤ n} ≠ ∅
  - I.e., states containing at least one position i#e where i = |W|

**Theorem 4.0.32 (Main Theorem)**: 
1. LEV_n(W) is a deterministic and acyclic Levenshtein automaton of degree n for W
2. For fixed degree n, the size of LEV_n(W) is linear in |W|

**Proof Sketch**:
- Deterministic: State transition Δ is a function (not a relation)
- Acyclic: States are characterized by base position i which only increases
- Linear size: Number of distinct states bounded by O(|W|) for fixed n
- Language: Accepts L_Lev(n,W) by construction (follows from elementary transitions)

---

## Chapter 5: Computation of Deterministic Levenshtein-Automata of Fixed Degree

**Pages**: 27-32

This chapter shows how to **construct LEV_n(W) in O(|W|) time** using parametric tables.

### 5.1: Construction for Degree n=1

**Key Insight**: For fixed n, the structure of states depends only on:
- Base position index i
- Characteristic vectors χ(x, W[i])

**Parametric States for n=1** (Table 5.1):

| State | Positions | When it occurs |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| A_i | {i#0} | Perfect match up to i |
| B_i | {i#0, i#1} | At i, 1 error possible |
| C_i | {i#0, (i+1)#1} | At i, error at next position |
| D_i | {i#0, i#1, (i+1)#1} | At i, errors at i and i+1 |
| E_i | {i#1} | 1 error, matched up to i |

**Final States**: A_w, B_w, C_w, D_w, E_w where w = |W|

**Transition Table T_1** (Table 5.2, pages 29-30):

For each state type and each possible characteristic vector, table specifies next state type.

**Example transitions** from A_i:

- χ(x, W[i+1:i+2]) = ⟨1⟩ → A_{i+1} (match)
- χ(x, W[i+1:i+2]) = ⟨0⟩ → E_{i+1} (mismatch, use 1 error)

**Construction Algorithm**:

```
Input: Word W = x₁...x_w, degree n = 1
Output: LEV_1(W)

1. Compute characteristic vectors χ(a, W[i:j]) for all relevant i,j,a

2. Initialize: current_state = A_0

3. For i = 0 to w:
     For each symbol a in Σ:
         Use table T_1 to determine next state type
         Record transition: Δ(current_state_type_i, a) = next_state_type_{i'}

4. Return automaton with states {A_i, B_i, C_i, D_i, E_i | 0 ≤ i ≤ w} 
   and transitions from step 3
```

**Complexity**: O(|W| × |Σ|) preprocessing + O(|W|) automaton construction

### 5.2: Extension to Higher Degrees

**Theorem 5.2.1**: For any fixed degree n, there exists an algorithm that computes LEV_n(W) in time and space O(|W|).

**Approach**:
1. Use raising lemma to build table T_n from T_{n-1}
2. Number of state types grows with n, but remains constant for fixed n
3. Table T_n has size O(1) for fixed n

**Corollary 5.2.2**: For any input W, the minimal deterministic Levenshtein-automaton of fixed degree n for W can be computed in time and space O(|W|).

**Practical Impact**: 
- For n=1: ~5 state types
- For n=2: ~20 state types
- For n=3: ~80 state types
- Pattern: O(4^n) state types, but constant for fixed n

---

## Chapter 6: String Correction Using Imitation of Levenshtein-Automata

**Pages**: 33-34

**Motivation**: Even with O(|W|) construction, explicitly building LEV_n(W) has overhead. Can we avoid it?

### Imitation Method

**Key Idea**: Use table T_n to simulate automaton behavior without constructing it.

**Algorithm**:

```
Input: Dictionary automaton A^D, word W, error bound n, table T_n
Output: All dictionary words within distance n from W

Initialize: stack = [(ε, q₀^D, {0#0})]

While stack not empty:
    Pop (V, q^D, M)  # V = word so far, q^D = dict state, M = simulated automaton state
    
    For each symbol x in Σ:
        # Dictionary transition
        q'_D := δ^D(q^D, x)
        
        # Simulated automaton transition (using table T_n)
        M' := Δ_*^W(M, χ(x, W[M]))  # Look up in T_n
        
        If q'_D ≠ NIL and M' ≠ NIL:
            V' := concat(V, x)
            Push (V', q'_D, M')
            
            If (q'_D ∈ F^D) and (M' is final for W):
                Output V'
```

**Advantages**:
1. **No upfront construction**: States generated on-demand
2. **Space efficient**: Only active states in memory
3. **Same time complexity**: Still O(|W|) + O(|D|)

**Characteristic Vector Computation**:

For state M = {i#0, ...} with base position i:
```
χ(x, W[M]) = χ(x, W[i+1:i+k])  where k = min(n+1, |W|-i)
```

Only need to compute characteristic vectors for active states during traversal.

---

## Chapter 7: Adding Transpositions

**Pages**: 35-46

**Motivation**: Transposition (swapping adjacent characters) is a common error type:
- "teh" → "the"
- "recieve" → "receive"

Damerau-Levenshtein distance includes transposition as a primitive operation.

### 7.1: t-Positions and t-States

**Definition 7.1.1**: A **t-position** has the form i#e_t where:
- i: index
- e: error count
- t ∈ {0,1}: transposition flag

**Meaning**:
- i#e_0: Regular position (no transposition in progress)
- i#e_1: Transposition in progress (expecting to match swapped character)

**Example**: For W = "hello":
- Reading "eh" when expecting "he":
  - 0#0_0 --e--> 0#1_1 (mismatch 'e', flag transposition)
  - 0#1_1 --h--> 1#1_0 (match swapped 'h', clear flag, increment position)

### 7.2: Extended Subsumption

**Definition 7.1.2**: For t-positions:
```
i#e_t ⊑ j#f_s  ⟺  (e < f) ∧ (|j-i| ≤ f-e) ∧ (t ≤ s)
```

Additional condition: regular position can subsume special position, but not vice versa.

### 7.3: Elementary Transitions with Transpositions

**Table 7.1** (page 37): Extended transition rules

**New cases** beyond Table 4.1:

**From regular position i#e_0**:
- If W[i+1] ≠ x but W[i+2] = x and e < n:
  - Add position (i)#(e+1)_1 to handle potential transposition

**From special position i#e_1**:
- If W[i+1] = x:
  - Transition to (i+1)#e_0 (complete transposition)

**Example**: W = "hello", position 1#0_0 (expecting "e"), input 'l':

Regular transition: χ('l', "el") = ⟨0,1⟩ → {1#1, 2#1, 3#1}
Transposition: W[2] = 'e', W[3] = 'l' → Also add {1#1_1}

### 7.4: Construction Algorithm

**Parametric States for n=1 with Transpositions**:

Similar to Table 5.1, but with t-positions:
- A_i = {i#0_0}
- B_i = {i#0_0, i#1_0}
- ...
- Plus new states with t=1 positions

**Tables 7.2 and 7.3** (pages 40-41): Transition tables for transposition variant

**Theorem 7.2.4**: For any fixed degree n, LEV^T_n(W) (with transpositions) can be computed in time and space O(|W|).

**State Count**: Approximately double the standard variant (due to transposition flag).

---

## Chapter 8: Adding Merges and Splits

**Pages**: 47-62

**Motivation**: Merge and split operations model common OCR errors:
- Merge: "rn" misread as "m"
- Split: "m" misread as "rn"

Also relevant for handwriting recognition and biological sequences.

### 8.1: s-Positions and s-States

**Definition 8.1.1**: An **s-position** has the form i#e_s where:
- i: index
- e: error count
- s ∈ {0,1}: merge/split flag

**Meaning**:
- i#e_0: Regular position
- i#e_1: Merge or split in progress

### 8.2: Elementary Transitions with Merge/Split

**Table 8.1** (page 48): Extended transition rules

**Merge operation** from i#e_0:
- If e < n:
  - Add position (i+2)#(e+1)_1 (skip two characters in W, one error)

**Split operation** from i#e_1:
- Special handling to consume extra input character

### 8.3: Experimental Results

**This section provides real-world performance data!**

**Test Dictionaries**:

1. **Bulgarian Lexicon (BL)**: 870,000 entries
2. **German Composite Nouns (GL)**: 6,058,198 entries

**Methodology**:
- Random words from dictionary
- Introduce random errors
- Measure correction time

**Table 8.4**: Bulgarian lexicon, standard operations (n=1,2)

| Word Length | n | Avg Candidates | Avg Time (ms) |

| 6-10 | 1 | 2.3 | 0.8 |

**Table 8.5**: German lexicon, standard operations (n=1,2)

| Word Length | n | Avg Candidates | Avg Time (ms) |
|-------------|---|----------------|---------------|
| 6-10 | 1 | 12.7 | 1.8 |
| 6-10 | 2 | 387.4 | 7.1 |
| 11-15 | 1 | 8.2 | 2.1 |
| 11-15 | 2 | 198.3 | 9.4 |

**Observations**:
- Linear growth with word length (as predicted)
- German lexicon slower (larger, more candidates)
- Sub-second queries for n≤2 on 6M word dictionary!

**Tables 8.6-8.9**: Results with transpositions and merge/split

- Transpositions add ~10-20% overhead
- Merge/split add ~15-25% overhead
- Still practical for real-time use

**Key Insight**: The algorithms are **production-ready**, not just theoretical.

## Chapter 9: Conclusion

**Pages**: 63-64

### Summary of Contributions

1. **Deterministic Levenshtein Automata**: Construction in O(|W|) time for fixed error bound n

2. **Parametric Tables**: Precomputed tables T_n enable efficient construction

3. **Imitation Method**: On-demand state generation without explicit automaton

4. **Extended Operations**: Transposition, merge, and split support with same complexity

5. **Experimental Validation**: Performance demonstrated on real dictionaries (870K and 6M entries)

### Side Results

**Lemma 9.0.2**: For any fixed n, given two words W and V of length w and v, it is decidable in time O(max(w,v)) if the Levenshtein-distance between W and V is ≤ n.

**Proof Idea**: Construct LEV_n(W) in O(w) time, check if V is accepted in O(v) time.

**Lemma 9.0.3**: For a fixed alphabet Σ and fixed n, there exists a finite number of minimal Levenshtein-automata of degree n.

- Different approach, complementary results

**Champarnaud et al.**: Work on weighted automata for error-correction
- More general but potentially less efficient for simple Levenshtein distance

**Oflazer (1996)**: Finite state transducers for error-tolerant recognition
- Transducer-based approach, more complex construction

### Future Research Directions

1. **Weighted Operations**: Variable costs for different edit types
2. **Context-Dependent Costs**: Costs depend on surrounding characters
3. **Restricted Substitution Sets**: Only certain character pairs allowed (→ Universal LA paper!)
4. **Approximate Matching with Wildcards**: Combine with regular expressions
5. **Phonetic Distance**: Integrate phonetic similarity
6. **Optimization**: Further reduce constants in O(|W|) complexity

**Note**: Several of these directions have been pursued in subsequent work, including the Universal Levenshtein Automata paper (documented in `/docs/research/universal-levenshtein/`).

## Key Theorems and Results

### Theorem 4.0.32 (Main Theorem)
LEV_n(W) is a deterministic and acyclic Levenshtein automaton of degree n for W. For fixed degree n, the size of LEV_n(W) is linear in |W|.

### Theorem 5.2.1 (Construction Complexity)
For any fixed degree n, there exists an algorithm that computes LEV_n(W) in time and space O(|W|).

### Corollary 5.2.2 (Minimality)
For any input W, the minimal deterministic Levenshtein-automaton of fixed degree n for W can be computed in time and space O(|W|).

### Theorem 7.2.4 (Transposition Variant)
For any fixed degree n, LEV^T_n(W) (with transpositions) can be computed in time and space O(|W|).

### Lemma 2.0.2 (Suffix Independence)
If W = UW' and V = UV', then d_L(V,W) = d_L(V',W').

### Lemma 4.0.17 (Subsumption Soundness)
If i#e ⊑ j#f, then L({j#f}) ⊆ L({i#e}).

### Lemma 4.0.27 (Raising Lemma)
For n > 0 and 1 ≤ e ≤ n: δ^(n)([π]↑e, x) = [δ^(n-e)(π, x)]↑e

### Proposition 4.0.31 (Position Language)
L({i#e}) = L_Lev(n-e, W[i+1:|W|])

### Lemma 9.0.2 (Distance Decision)
For any fixed n, given two words W and V of length w and v, it is decidable in time O(max(w,v)) if the Levenshtein-distance between W and V is ≤ n.
