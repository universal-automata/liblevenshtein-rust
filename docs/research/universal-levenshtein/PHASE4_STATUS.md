# Phase 4: Universal Automaton - Current Status

## Summary

Phase 4 implementation has made significant progress. The bit vector positioning bug has been fixed, and 6 out of 10 acceptance tests now pass.

## Test Status

### Passing (6/10):
1. `test_accepts_empty_to_empty` ✓
2. `test_accepts_deletion` ✓
3. `test_accepts_identical` ✓
4. `test_accepts_empty_word` ✓
5. `test_accepts_insertion` ✓
6. `test_accepts_to_empty` ✓

### Failing (4/10):
1. `test_accepts_substitution` - "test" → "text" (1 substitution)
2. `test_accepts_multiple_edits` - "test" → "best" (1 substitution)
3. `test_accepts_n1` - "test" → "text" with n=1
4. `test_accepts_longer_words` - "algorithm" → "algorythm" (1 substitution)

## Key Fix Applied

**Bit Vector Position Bug (FIXED)**

The major bug was in how I-type positions checked for matches. The code was using `starts_with_one()` which checked if the bit vector started with a 1, but this was wrong because:

- For position I+offset#errors at input k, the concrete word position is i = offset + k
- The bit vector s_n(w,k) starts at position k-n
- Position i in the bit vector corresponds to index: i - (k-n) = offset + n

**Fix**: Changed from `bit_vector.starts_with_one()` to `bit_vector.is_match(offset + max_distance)`.

This fixed identical word matching and single edit operations (insertion, deletion).

## Remaining Issue

**Substitutions are NOT working**.

All 4 failing tests involve substitutions:
- "test" → "text": substitution at position 3 (s→x)
- "test" → "best": substitution at position 1 (t→b)
- "algorithm" → "algorythm": substitution at position 5 (i→y)

### Hypothesis

The error transitions should handle substitutions correctly via the `i+1#e+1` transition (which becomes I+offset#(errors+1) after I^ε conversion). This transition is present in the code.

The issue might be:
1. The substitution transition is being subsumed by another position
2. The acceptance condition is rejecting valid final states
3. There's a subtle bug in how positions are converted or checked

### Next Steps

1. Add detailed debug tracing for "test" → "text" to see:
   - What positions are generated at each step
   - Whether the substitution position I+0#1 is created and persists
   - What the final state looks like
   - Why acceptance fails

2. Check if the substitution position is being subsumed incorrectly

3. Verify the acceptance condition for states with errors > 0

## Diagonal Crossing

Diagonal crossing integration is currently DISABLED (commented out in state.rs lines 307-342) because it was triggering too early and causing position conversions that violated invariants.

This needs to be fixed once the acceptance logic is working correctly. The diagonal crossing should only apply when we've actually crossed the diagonal (input position > word length + offset adjustments).

## Code Changes Made

1. `src/transducer/universal/position.rs`:
   - Line 387-402: Fixed I-type match check to use `offset + max_distance` index
   - Line 448-469: Fixed skip-to-match logic with proper bounds checking

2. `src/transducer/universal/automaton.rs`:
   - Removed debug output (was temporarily added for investigation)

3. `src/transducer/universal/state.rs`:
   - Removed debug output
   - Diagonal crossing remains disabled (commented out)
