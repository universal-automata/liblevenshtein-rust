# Research and Analysis

Performance research, optimization analysis, and experimental features.

## Active Research Initiatives (2025-11-11)

**Status**: Phase 6 complete (100% feature parity) - Ready for advanced optimizations

### 📋 Planning Documents
- **[Research Initiatives](./RESEARCH_INITIATIVES.md)** - Comprehensive plans for 3 research projects (50+ pages)
- **[Research Tracking](./RESEARCH_TRACKING.md)** - Progress tracking, methodology standards, decision log

### 🎯 Planned Initiatives
1. **SIMD Edge Search** (2-4 weeks) - Extract SIMD from OptimizedDawg, test in DynamicDawg
2. **Hybrid Storage** (4-6 weeks) - Arena/per-node hybrid for immutable dictionaries
3. **DAT/DAWG Hybrid** (8-12 weeks) - Novel BASE+CHECK + suffix sharing algorithm

**Context**: Identified during OptimizedDawg deprecation analysis (deprecated: 5-12× slower than DynamicDawg)
