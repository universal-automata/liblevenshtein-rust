**Status**: Complete with Optimization

**Implementations**:

#### 1. Edge Label Search SIMD (`src/transducer/simd.rs:1103-1264`)
- Generic over `T` (supports both `usize` and `u32` targets)
- SSE4.1 implementation: 16-way byte comparison
- Data-driven thresholds based on empirical benchmarking

**Integration Points**:
1. `src/dictionary/dawg.rs`: DAWG dictionary transition
2. `src/dictionary/dawg_optimized.rs`: Optimized DAWG with u32 targets

**Optimization Journey**:
- **Initial thresholds (suboptimal)**: Enabled SIMD at 4 edges
  - Result: 2-3x **slower** due to 10ns SIMD overhead
- **Optimized thresholds (data-driven)**:
  - Scalar: < 12 edges (avoids SIMD overhead)
  - SSE4.1: 12-16 edges (provides 1.24x speedup at 16)
  - Scalar: 17+ edges (SSE4.1 limited to 16 bytes)
  - AVX2: Disabled (buffer copy overhead issue)

**Performance Results (After Optimization)**:
- 4 edges: **64% faster** (3.54ns vs 10.03ns)

### âœ… Batch 2C: Epsilon Closure and State Retention

**Status**: Mostly N/A (Already optimized in previous batches)

**Analysis**:
- **Epsilon closure**: Sequential BFS-style algorithm, not suitable for SIMD
- **Position subsumption**: Already SIMD-optimized in Batch 2A
- **State minimum distance**: Already SIMD-optimized in Batch 2A
- **State retention**: Uses standard Vec/SmallVec operations (already optimized)

**Conclusion**: No additional SIMD work needed for this batch.

---

### âœ… Batch 3: Distance Matrix SIMD

**Status**: Complete (Pre-existing implementation)

**Implementations**:

#### 1. Standard Distance SIMD (`src/distance/simd.rs`)
- AVX2 implementation: 8 u32 values in parallel
- SSE4.1 implementation: 4 u32 values in parallel
- Automatic threshold-based dispatch
- **Integration**: `distance::standard_distance()` uses SIMD when feature enabled

**Testing**: Existing distance benchmarks

**Note**: Transposition and Merge-and-Split distance SIMD were not implemented as they are less commonly used and would provide marginal benefits given their algorithmic complexity.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Threshold Tuning is Critical
**Problem**: Initial thresholds enabled SIMD too aggressively (at 4 edges)
**Result**: 2-3x performance regression due to ~10ns SIMD overhead
**Solution**: Data-driven threshold adjustment (12-16 edges for SSE4.1)
**Outcome**: 20-64% performance improvements

### 2. Measure, Don't Guess
**Approach**: Comprehensive benchmarking before optimization decisions
**Example**: AVX2 was 47% slower than scalar at 32 edges due to buffer copy overhead
**Takeaway**: Empirical data is essential for SIMD optimization

### 3. SIMD Overhead is Real
**Fixed Cost**: ~10ns for setup (buffer copy, load, broadcast, extract)
**Crossover Point**: SIMD only wins when parallelism > overhead
**Threshold**: SSE4.1 breakeven at ~12 edges for this workload

### 4. Architecture Matters
**AVX2 vs SSE4.1**: AVX2 buffer copy overhead dominated performance
**Solution**: Use SSE4.1 for 12-16 edges, avoid AVX2 for this operation
**Generalization**: Profile on target architectures before deploying

### 5. Position Independence is Valuable
**SIMD Benefit**: Consistent ~8.5ns regardless of match position
**Scalar Behavior**: 1.5ns (first) to 12ns (last) - 8x variation
**Use Case**: Predictable performance for scheduling and latency optimization

## Future Work (Optional)

### Potential Optimizations
1. **Pre-extracted Label Arrays**: Store edge labels separately in DAWG for direct SIMD load
2. **Batch Edge Lookups**: Process multiple nodes simultaneously
3. **AVX-512 Support**: For systems with AVX-512 (32-64 byte comparisons)
4. **ARM NEON**: Port SIMD operations to ARM architecture
5. **Transposition Distance SIMD**: If usage patterns warrant (currently rare)
6. **Merge-and-Split Distance SIMD**: If usage patterns warrant (currently rare)

### Threshold Refinement
- Collect production workload statistics
- Adjust thresholds based on real-world edge count distributions
- Consider adaptive thresholds based on workload characteristics
