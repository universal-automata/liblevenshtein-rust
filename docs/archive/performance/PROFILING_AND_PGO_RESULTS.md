# Profiling and Profile-Guided Optimization Results

## Summary

Comprehensive profiling using flame graphs identified critical bottlenecks in the liblevenshtein-rust library. Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) has been successfully set up to optimize hot paths based on real-world usage patterns.

## Profiling Setup

### Tools Used
- **cargo-flamegraph**: For generating visual flame graphs of hot paths
- **perf**: Linux performance analysis tool (underlying flamegraph)
- **LLVM PGO toolchain**: For profile-guided optimization

### Profiling Benchmark

Created `benches/profiling_benchmark.rs` to exercise realistic workloads:

**Workload Characteristics:**
- 10,000-word dictionary (from `/usr/share/dict/words` or synthetic)
- 5,000 fuzzy string queries with edit distance 1-2
- 1,000,000 dictionary `contains()` calls
- Exercises all hot paths: DAWG construction, edge lookup, transducer queries

**Benchmark Results:**
```
Dictionary: 10,000 words
DAWG construction: 2.5ms
Transducer construction: 34ns
5,000 queries: 4.1 seconds (avg 823µs per query)
1M contains() calls: 165ms
Total query results: 1,084,000 matches found
```

## Flame Graph Analysis

Generated two flame graphs:
1. `flamegraph.svg` - Initial profiling (queries returned 0 results)
2. `flamegraph_improved.svg` - Improved with realistic queries (1.08M results)

### Key Findings from Flame Graph

#### 1. Arc Reference Counting Overhead (~41% of execution time)

**The #1 Bottleneck: Arc atomic operations dominate execution**

- **Arc::clone (increment)**: ~20.77%
  - `core::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize::fetch_add`: 17.18% in `transition()`, 3.59% in `root()`
  - 97M + 20M atomic increment samples
  - Every edge transition clones the Arc to the node vector

- **Arc::drop (decrement)**: ~20.65%
  - `core::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize::fetch_sub`: 116M atomic decrement samples
  - Dropping DawgDictionaryNode after each operation

**Root Cause:**
```rust
// Current implementation in dawg.rs:282-306
fn transition(&self, label: u8) -> Option<Self> {
    // ...
    Some(DawgDictionaryNode {
        nodes: Arc::clone(&self.nodes),  // <-- Atomic increment here!
        node_idx: *idx,
    })
}

// When dropped:
impl Drop for Arc {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // Atomic decrement here!
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ~232M atomic operations total
- Each atomic operation involves expensive cache coherency protocol
- Dominates all other operations by factor of 2x

#### 2. Binary Search Edge Lookup (~26.88% of execution time)

**Hot Path: Adaptive edge lookup working as designed**

- `core::slice::<impl [T]>::binary_search_by_key`: 152M samples (26.88%)
- Shows adaptive optimization triggering (threshold: 8 edges)
- Within binary search:
  - `<core::cmp::Ordering as core::cmp::PartialEq>::eq`: 5.85%
  - `core::hint::select_unpredictable`: 7.60%
  - `core::slice::<impl [T]>::get_unchecked`: 7.54%

**Analysis:**
This is expected and optimal - binary search for nodes with ≥8 edges. Previous benchmarks showed:
- Linear search faster for <8 edges (cache-friendly)
- Binary search faster for ≥8 edges (O(log n) dominates)

#### 3. Vector Operations (~10.66% of execution time)

- `alloc::vec::Vec<T,A>::len`: 60M samples (10.66%)
- Accessing edge vectors and checking lengths

#### 4. Dictionary Contains (~93.94% of execution time)

- Primary workload as expected from profiling benchmark
- `liblevenshtein::dictionary::Dictionary::contains`: 531M samples

### Profiling Insights

**Hot Path Breakdown:**
1. **Arc overhead**: 41% - **Primary optimization target**
2. **Binary search**: 27% - Optimal (recently optimized)
3. **Vector ops**: 11% - Normal overhead
4. **Other**: 21%

**Critical Finding:**
> Arc reference counting overhead exceeds all other operations combined, including the binary search optimization we just implemented. This represents the next major optimization opportunity.

## Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)

### PGO Setup

Created automated PGO build script: `pgo_build.sh`

**PGO Workflow:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# 1. Clean previous data
rm -rf /tmp/pgo-data && mkdir -p /tmp/pgo-data

# 2. Build with instrumentation
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -C profile-generate=/tmp/pgo-data" \
    cargo build --release --bench profiling_benchmark

# 3. Run profiling workload
./target/release/deps/profiling_benchmark-*

# 4. Merge profiling data
llvm-profdata merge -o /tmp/pgo-data/merged.profdata /tmp/pgo-data/*.profraw

# 5. Build with PGO
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -C profile-use=/tmp/pgo-data/merged.profdata" \
    cargo build --release
```

### PGO Build Results

**Successful PGO build completed:**
```
Step 1: Instrumented build: 11.62s
Step 2: Profiling run: 5.52s (queries) + 0.20s (contains)
Step 3: Data merge: ~1s
Step 4: PGO-optimized build: 14.76s
Total PGO workflow: ~32 seconds
```

**PGO Optimizations Applied:**
- Function inlining based on call frequency
- Branch prediction based on actual execution
- Code layout optimization for cache locality
- Dead code elimination based on profiling data

### PGO Binary

PGO-optimized binary: `target/release/liblevenshtein-cli` (11MB)

The compiler now has profiling data showing:
- Arc cloning is the dominant hot path
- Binary search paths are frequently taken
- Specific query patterns and edge distributions

## Optimization Recommendations

### Phase 2: Arc Overhead Reduction (High Priority)

**Problem:** 41% of execution time spent on Arc atomic operations

**Solutions:**

1. **Replace Arc with Rc for single-threaded use**
   - Benefit: Eliminate atomic operations entirely
   - Trade-off: Not thread-safe
   - Implementation: Add `DawgDictionaryNode` variant with `Rc`

2. **Use raw pointers with manual lifetime management**
   - Benefit: Zero overhead
   - Trade-off: Unsafe code, complex lifetime tracking
   - Implementation: Store `*const Vec<DawgNode>` with lifetime parameter

3. **Copy-on-write with bump allocator**
   - Benefit: Amortize Arc clones across many operations
   - Trade-off: Higher memory usage temporarily
   - Implementation: Use arena allocator for nodes

4. **Cache DawgDictionaryNode between operations**
   - Benefit: Reduce clone frequency
   - Trade-off: More complex API
   - Implementation: Reuse nodes in iterator

**Expected Impact:** 15-30% overall performance improvement

### Phase 3: Further Optimizations

Based on profiling, lower-priority optimizations:

1. **Inline Vector Length Checks** (10.66% overhead)
   - Use `#[inline(always)]` on hot paths
   - Pre-compute lengths where possible

2. **SIMD Edge Lookup** (potential 5-10% improvement)
   - Use SIMD for linear search in small edge lists
   - Benefit most visible for 4-8 edge nodes

3. **Memory Pool for State Objects**
   - Reduce allocation overhead in transducer
   - Reuse State objects between queries

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Profiling infrastructure set up
2. ✅ Flame graphs generated and analyzed
3. ✅ PGO build system established
4. ⏳ Run PGO benchmarks to measure improvement
5. ⏳ Implement Phase 2: Arc overhead reduction
6. ⏳ Benchmark Arc optimization improvements
7. ⏳ Consider thread-safety requirements before Rc migration
