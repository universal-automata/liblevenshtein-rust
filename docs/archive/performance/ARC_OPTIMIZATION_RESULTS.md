# Arc Reference Counting Optimization Results

## Executive Summary

After profiling identified **Arc overhead as 41% of execution time**, we implemented targeted optimizations that delivered:

- **contains() operations: 57-66% faster** (2-3x speedup)
- **Edge iteration: 20-26% faster**
- **End-to-end realistic workload: 57% faster lookups, 14% faster queries**

These optimizations **far exceed PGO's 1-4% gains** and represent the highest-impact performance improvement for liblevenshtein-rust.

## Background: Profiling Revealed Arc as #1 Bottleneck

### Flame Graph Analysis

Profiling with a realistic workload (10k words, 5k queries, 1M contains() calls) revealed:

**Arc overhead: 41% of total execution time**
- `Arc::clone` (atomic increment): 20.77% (117M samples)
- `Arc::drop` (atomic decrement): 20.65% (116M samples)
- **Total atomic operations: 232 million**

Other operations for comparison:
- Binary search: 27%
- Vector operations: 11%
- Hash operations: 8%

**Conclusion:** Arc overhead is 1.5x larger than binary search and **10x more impactful** than PGO's potential gains.

## Optimization 1: Arc-Free `contains()` Method

### Problem

The default `contains()` implementation from the `Dictionary` trait works through the `DictionaryNode` API:

```rust
// Default implementation (trait default)
fn contains(&self, term: &str) -> bool {
    let mut node = self.root();  // Arc::clone here
    for byte in term.as_bytes() {
        match node.transition(*byte) {  // Arc::clone on each transition
            Some(next) => node = next,
            None => return false,
        }
    }
    node.is_final()
}
```

For a term with N characters, this performs:
- 1 Arc clone in `root()`
- N Arc clones in `transition()` (one per character)
- **Total: N+1 Arc clones per lookup**

With 1M contains() calls in profiling, this resulted in hundreds of millions of atomic operations.

### Solution

Override `contains()` in `DawgDictionary` to work directly with node indices:

```rust
// Optimized implementation (src/dictionary/dawg.rs:271-299)
fn contains(&self, term: &str) -> bool {
    let mut node_idx = 0; // Start at root (no Arc clone)

    for &byte in term.as_bytes() {
        let edges = &self.nodes[node_idx].edges;

        // Use adaptive search strategy (same as transition())
        let next_idx = if edges.len() < 8 {
            // Linear search for small edge counts
            edges.iter().find(|(l, _)| *l == byte).map(|(_, idx)| *idx)
        } else {
            // Binary search for large edge counts
            edges
                .binary_search_by_key(&byte, |(l, _)| *l)
                .ok()
                .map(|pos| edges[pos].1)
        };

        match next_idx {
            Some(idx) => node_idx = idx,
            None => return false,
        }
    }

    self.nodes[node_idx].is_final
}
```

**Key improvement:** Works with `usize` indices instead of `DawgDictionaryNode`, completely eliminating all Arc operations.

### Benchmark Results: `contains()`

| Dictionary Size | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 100 terms | 9.30 µs | 3.13 µs | **-66.3% (3.0x faster)** |
| 500 terms | 9.60 µs | 3.22 µs | **-66.4% (2.98x faster)** |
| 1000 terms | 9.61 µs | 3.84 µs | **-60.1% (2.50x faster)** |
| 5000 terms | 9.71 µs | 3.86 µs | **-60.2% (2.52x faster)** |

**Average improvement: 60-66% faster (2.5-3x speedup)**

## Optimization 2: Reduced Arc Clones in `edges()` Iterator

### Problem

The original `edges()` iterator implementation cloned Arc unnecessarily:

```rust
// Original implementation
fn edges(&self) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = (u8, Self)> + '_> {
    let nodes = Arc::clone(&self.nodes);  // Clone 1 (upfront)
    let iter = self.nodes[self.node_idx]
        .edges
        .iter()
        .map(move |(label, idx)| {  // 'move' captures nodes
            (
                *label,
                DawgDictionaryNode {
                    nodes: Arc::clone(&nodes),  // Clone 2, 3, 4... (per edge)
                    node_idx: *idx,
                },
            )
        });
    Box::new(iter)
}
```

For a node with N edges, this performed **N+1 Arc clones**:
- 1 upfront clone to capture in closure
- N clones inside the map (one per edge returned)

### Solution

Capture `self` by reference instead of cloning Arc upfront:

```rust
// Optimized implementation (src/dictionary/dawg.rs:343-360)
fn edges(&self) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = (u8, Self)> + '_> {
    // Optimized: capture self by reference instead of cloning Arc upfront.
    // This reduces Arc clones from N+1 to N (one per edge returned).
    Box::new(
        self.nodes[self.node_idx]
            .edges
            .iter()
            .map(|(label, idx)| {
                (
                    *label,
                    DawgDictionaryNode {
                        nodes: Arc::clone(&self.nodes),  // Clone only when edge is consumed
                        node_idx: *idx,
                    },
                )
            }),
    )
}
```

**Key improvement:** Reduced from N+1 to N Arc clones by eliminating the upfront clone.

### Benchmark Results: `edges()` Iterator

| Dictionary Size | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 100 terms | 2.12 µs | 1.57 µs | **-26.0% (1.35x faster)** |
| 500 terms | 1.95 µs | 1.56 µs | **-19.9% (1.25x faster)** |
| 1000 terms | 2.00 µs | 1.57 µs | **-21.3% (1.27x faster)** |
| 5000 terms | 1.97 µs | 1.55 µs | **-21.7% (1.28x faster)** |

**Average improvement: 20-26% faster**

## End-to-End Impact: Realistic Workload

Profiling benchmark simulates real-world usage:
- 10,000-word dictionary
- 5,000 fuzzy queries (edit distance 1-2)
- 1,000,000 contains() calls

### Results

| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **1M contains() calls** | 203.48 ms | 87.18 ms | **-57.2% (2.3x faster)** |
| **5k fuzzy queries** | 4.71 s (942 µs/query) | 4.06 s (812 µs/query) | **-13.8% faster** |
| **DAWG construction** | 3.24 ms | 2.44 ms | -24.6% faster |

**Key takeaway:** Contains() operations are **2.3x faster**, with significant improvements to query performance as well.

## Comparison to Other Optimizations

| Optimization | Impact | Effort | ROI |
|--------------|--------|--------|-----|
| **Arc optimization** | **57-66% contains(), 14% queries** | Medium | **Highest** |
| Adaptive edge lookup | 3-14% (mixed results) | Low | Medium |
| Binary insertion | 13% insertion, -2% lookup | Low | Medium |
| PGO | 1-4% lookups, -2-6% construction | High | **Low** |

**Verdict:** Arc optimization provides **10-15x more value** than PGO and is the single highest-impact optimization for liblevenshtein-rust.

## Technical Details

### Why `contains()` Can Be Arc-Free

The `Dictionary` trait defines a default `contains()` that works through the `DictionaryNode` API. This is necessary for generic implementations but creates Arc overhead.

For `DawgDictionary` specifically, we can override `contains()` because:
1. We have direct access to the internal nodes array
2. DAWG traversal can use indices instead of DictionaryNode instances
3. No trait requirements prevent this optimization

This is an example of **specialization**: providing a more efficient implementation for a specific type while maintaining trait compatibility.

### Why `edges()` Can't Be Fully Arc-Free

The `DictionaryNode::edges()` trait method **must return owned `DawgDictionaryNode` instances**:

```rust
fn edges(&self) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = (u8, Self)> + '_>;
```

Each returned node must own an `Arc`, so we can't eliminate Arc clones entirely. However, we reduced clones from N+1 to N by avoiding the upfront clone.

### Remaining Arc Overhead

Arc clones are still required in:
1. **`transition()` method**: Returns owned `DawgDictionaryNode` (trait requirement)
2. **`edges()` iterator**: Returns N owned nodes (trait requirement)
3. **Query operations**: Stores DawgDictionaryNode instances in state

These could be optimized by:
- Creating Arc-free query traversal (advanced optimization)
- Using node indices internally in transducer (requires API changes)
- Caching Arc references (complexity vs benefit tradeoff)
